\SectionStartWords{Pleuritis} is a disease which often presents obscure, important and interesting
complications, taxing the utmost skill of the experienced physician
in tracing the precise bearing and extent of the morbid action
established.

The heart, lungs, bronchia and liver are often implicated in this disease.
Asthenic pneumonia, and chronic and latent pleuritis have many common

whisper was the result of all his efforts at conversation. This condition
continued for one month when to his surprise and great joy he found

on so strange and unexpected a recovery. He said that while making
some slight exertion he felt something give away in his chest and immediately
he could talk as well as ever. At the end of one week he
was again deprived of speech in the same unexpected and sudden manner.
His physician after inspecting his throat, but making no other
examination, prescribed a gargle of ``pepper tea'' saying it would soon\endinput
