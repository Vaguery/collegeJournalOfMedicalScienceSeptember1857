\subsection*{The Boston Journal and Patents.}

\SectionStartWords{It} is somewhat amusing to see the various \emph{inconsistencies} would-be
conservatives often indulge in. Even the fossiliferous \booktitle{Boston Medical
and Surgical Journal}, the type of conservatism has recently commended
a patented article, and according to the Ethics of the Am.\ 
Med.\ Association, has now placed itself quite beyond the pale of the
\emph{regular} profession. In an Editorial published in the Journal for June
the 25th, it adopts the usual style of the paid Editorials of the secular
papers while puffing nostrums, and says:

``Although we are always reluctant to recommend any medicine or
instrument, with the virtues of which we are not personally acquainted,
we are induced by the favorable opinion expressed to us by two of
the most eminent physicians of this city concerning \emph{Parker's Patent},''
etc., etc., ``to invite the attention of the profession to a contrivance
which seems admirably adapted,'' etc., etc. In February last while
giving a commendatory notice of another patented article, the Boston
Journal was a little more cautious, and left out the word ``patent,''
possibly with the idea of thus escaping the fiat of excommunication
which was pronounced against the State Medical Society, of Ohio.
