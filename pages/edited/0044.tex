\SectionStartWords{This} little volume receives a hearty welcome; it is one of those rare
works we occasionally meet with in which the useful is combined
with the ornamental, and we find something in each page which will
amuse and instruct.

The style is simple and clear, and at the same time beautiful and
comprehensive. The dull monotony that too often characterizes such
works is not observable here, but each page is enriched with original
thought, clothed in language which the child may understand, and the
sage may read with pleasure.

The Author imagines himself standing sentinel to the city of the Soul
described by \ProperName{John Bunyan}, and as he watched the five gates known
as the ``Eye-gate, Ear-gate, Nose-gate, Mouth-gate, and Feel-gate,'' he
records all who bear tidings to the dwellers within.

Seldom have we seen so many of the truths of philosophy enriched
by the beauties of poetry. In his description of the Ear the following
occurs which we give as characteristic of the work.

``But music is never more delightful than when listened to in utter
darkness without obtrusion of music paper, or instrument, or performers,
and whilst we forget that we have ears, and are content to be living
souls floating in a sea of melodious sound.''

We cannot recommend the work more highly than to advise our readers
to obtain and read it for themselves.\hfill{}J.\quad{}
