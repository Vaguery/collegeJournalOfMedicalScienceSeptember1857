<p><span class=font2>presence of the cholera miasm, and that it must come in contact with<br>all these structures.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Neither may we loose sight of the fact that cholera has often been<br>produced by what is styled the <i>contagium jpsychicum. </i>It is a well-<br>established fact that many die through a fear of the disease, and par-<br>ticularly through the influence of the sight of a cholera case upon an<br>impressible person. Many doubtless are thus led to suffer from the<br>epidemic who otherwise would have entirely escaped it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>With regard to which is first acted upon, the blood or the nervous<br>system, I think the true answer is that in this regard there is a great<br>diversity in the different cases, but that in many cases both the blood<br>and the nerves are simultaneously impressed.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Has the cholera miasm and the Asiatic cholera undergone any alter-<br>ations in its original nature and character in its transit ? Does it always<br>present forerunners of epidemics ? Has it always also been followed by<br>other forms of epidemic disease as it has passed away ?</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>The cholera miasm has certainly <i>not </i>undergone any change but re-<br>mains ever the same in nature and quality as when it started from the<br>Punjaub as is shown by the unaltered and specific character of the epi-<br>demic in all climes and seasons, without any regard to the state of the<br>weather, uninfluenced by heat or cold, or dryness or moisture. But no<br>one will deny that the cholera miasm and consequently the disease<br>which it produces does loose from time to time apart of its potency and<br>assume a more mild and manageable form, for the history of its various<br>epidemics has fully established these facts. But the succeeding epi-<br>demic is found to equal in intensity any former, and the one of the year<br>1855 in the month of May, was more intense and destructive than any<br>which had preceded it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>In most instances preceding an epidemic of cholera, other epidemics<br>have been observed as preceding this, as intermittents, diarrhoea, dys-<br>entery. So also after the epidemic of cholera has passed by, have<br>epidemic forms of disease appeared, as typhus, influenza, etc. These<br>observations have led to the opinion that the preceding diseases might<br>be considered as the forebodings of cholera, and the succeeding as the<br>sequelae of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>I have already pointed out the common sources from which all<br>miasms arise and hence the connections of these various forms of epi-<br>demic diseases can be explained without our concluding there is any-<br>thing more in common with these miasms than simply a relationship<br>of origin.</span></p>
