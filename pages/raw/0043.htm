<p><span class=font1>a certain unity with the Divine Nature;&quot; * * * &quot; that the salva-<br>tion of man—his transformation from evil to good, or his passage from<br>a state of nature to a state of grace—was symbolized under the figure<br>of the transmutation of metals, * * * that the Alchemists were<br><i>Reformers </i>in their time, * * that they were religious men when<br>the spirit of religion was buried in forms and ceremonies, and when<br>the priesthood had armed itself with the civil power to put down all<br>opposition, and suppress all freedom, intellectual, civil, moral and re-<br>ligious.&quot; Hence these <i>freemen </i>were accustomed to w<sup>7</sup>rite and speak<br>to each other in symbolic language, using the terms salt, sulphur, gold,<br>mercury, etc., while refering to principles and truth.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>According to the writer of this volume, the whole subject of Alchemy<br>is Man, but each writer for the most part designated man by a word of<br>his ow<sup>T</sup>n choosing. Hence one called man Antimony, another Lead,<br>another Zinc, etc., and under these and similar names we can if we<br>choose to investigate the matter, learn what those writers thought of<br>God, Nature, and Man, or Man, Nature and God—one and three, three<br>and one. That the Alchemists were Protestants, when Protestantism<br>could not find open free speech for fear of the <i>auto da fe, </i>the dungeon<br>or the stake, seems apparent from their entire writings, and that their<br>opinions were expressed to each other in quaint language, distinctly<br>understood by each other, but unintelligible to the uninitiated : that<br>Alchemy, or Hermetic Philosophy, was a religious philosophy or faith,<br>and the writers on this subject teachers of the new—or protestant form<br>of religion, rather than of new ideas in chemistry.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b><i>The Physician's Visiting List, Diary, and Book of Engagements for </i>1858. Philadelphia,<br>Lindsat and Blakiston.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>T</b><span class=font0><b>he </b></span>united voice of all who have enjoyed the facilities and advant-<br>ages of this Pocket Account Book and Diary has been only in praise<br>of this convenient Annual, which has become a <i>necessity </i>to those who<br>have used it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>It contains an Almanac, a Table of Poisons and their Antidotes<br>(rather too brief), a Table for calculating the period of Utero Gestation,<br>a Visiting list for the year, for 25 or 50 patients daily, and a vast<br>amount of other convenient memoranda, by means of which physicians<br>avoid errors, or forgetfulness—and by the aid of which many times<br>the cost of the work may be saved daily.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>This Visiting List is bound in a convenient form, and should be found<br>in the pocket of each practicing phys ician. Copies can be sent by mail<br>for $0,75, and $1,00.</span></p>
