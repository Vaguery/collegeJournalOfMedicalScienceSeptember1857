<p><span class=font0><b>THE BOSTON JOURNAL AND PATENTS.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>I</b><span class=font0><b>t </b></span>is somewhat amusing to see the various <i>inconsistencies </i>would-be<br>conservatives often indulge in. Even the fossiliferous <i>Boston Medical<br>and Surgical Journal, </i>the type of conservatism has recently com-<br>mended a patented article, and according to the Ethics of the Am.<br>Med. Association, has now placed itself quite beyond the pale of the<br><i>regular </i>profession. In an Editorial published in the Journal for June<br>the 25th, it adopts the usual style of the paid Editorials of the secular<br>papers while puffing nostrums, and says:</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>&quot; Although we are always reluctant to recommend any medicine or<br>instrument, with the virtues of which we are not personally acquainted,<br>we are induced by the favorable opinion expressed to us by two of<br>the most eminent physicians of this city concerning <i>Parker's Patent&quot;<br></i>etc., etc., <sup>u</sup> to invite the attention of the profession to a contrivance<br>which seems admirably adapted,&quot; etc., etc. In February last while<br>giving a commendatory notice of another patented article, the Boston<br>Journal was a little more cautious, and left out the word &quot;patent,&quot;<br>possibly with the idea of thus escaping the fiat of excommunication<br>which was pronounced against the State Medical Society, of Ohio.</span></p>

We will consider it a favor to be furnished with still<br>farther information in regard to this book, and the remedies used by Dr.<br><b>M</b><span class=font0><b>egelin.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>MEETING OF THE INDIANA ECLETIC STATE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.</b></span></p>
