<p><span class=font0>388&nbsp;<i>Nature and Causes of Asiatic Cholera. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>class supposing the atony of the vessels and the consequent out-flux<br>of the fluid impairs the nerves, while the other supposes that a poison<br>has been introduced into the system which acting directly on the brain<br>thus lessens the nerve power, and the loss of that power leads to the<br>atony of the blood-vessels and consequent exhalation of the serum.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>There seems to be <i>three </i>principle classes of opinions as to the primal<br>nature of cholera. 1st. A primary poisoning of&quot;the blood. 2nd. A<br>primary affection of the nerves. 3d. A primary local affection of the<br>alimentary canal.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>From what has been said, we may perhaps draw the conclusion, that<br>cholera, like other epidemics, as scarlatina, measles, intermittent fever,<br>typhus fever, influenza, etc., owes its origin to a cause having a uniform<br>origin, or at least a uniform character, while, as in the other instances,<br>as to its peculiar nature, w<sup>T</sup>e may be entirely ignorant. Many physicians<br>have striven hard to learn the exact nature and character of this mor-<br>bific agent, and yet they have acknowledged a want of success.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>With others, I too, have tried to solve this mystery and having had<br>an opportunity of observing personally more than two thousand cases<br>of cholera in different epidemics, I am led to present the following ob-<br>servations.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Cholera does not appear every where and at all times to possess pre-<br>cisely the same characteristics. At one time it will appear mild and<br>very easily cured. But this slight form only appears in those persons<br>whose systems appear to have but a slight <i>disposition </i>for the disease,<br>and hence it cannot exert as powerful an influence upon such as it does<br>upon those who are more predisposed to its attacks, and the disease will<br>take <i>the form of cholera periculosa exquisita.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Most of those who are disposed to inflammatory disease seem also<br>disposed to receive cholera, and hence the tw<sup>r</sup>o diseases are often met<br>with in company. In <i>&quot;cholera febrilis&quot; </i>there are several congestions<br>of the head, the lungs, or heart, in conjunction with the more ordinary<br>symptoms of cholera. In persons who have a predominating disposi-<br>tion to vomit, the cholera will commence with vomiting, wdiile with<br>those who are disposed to looseness of the bowels, it will commence<br>with a diarrhoea, while with those who are predisposed to the cholera,<br>and at the same time their nervous and arterial systems are equally<br>susceptible, the disease will take the form of <i>cholera fulminitisima<br>asphyctica.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Climate exercises upon any prevailing disease a powerful influence.<br>This is manifested in epidemic cholera. In some countries and cli-<br>mates, it appears as <i>cholera febrHis, </i>with intense congestions ; in others</span></p>
