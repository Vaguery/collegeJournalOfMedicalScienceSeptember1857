<p><span class=font2>into the nostrils the fumes of burning sugar, ginger and cinnabar,<br>has comprised a part of the treatment for catarrh, but it is attended<br>with too little success to favor repetition.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Dr. Ira Warren, of Boston, for many years has douched the nostrils<br>and pharynx with a solution of nitrate of silver, employing a syringe<br>with a long curved nozzle.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Instead of any of the above treatment, <b>1 </b>would recommend the pa-<br>tient to take in some convenient vehicle the muriate or chloride of gold<br>in one-twentieth grain doses three times a day, and make frequent use<br>of an errhine composed of pulverized kalmia angustifolia and sassafras,<br>equal parts. Tincture of Bryonia inhaled, often proves serviceable in<br>this disease, and when there is much pain in the head chloroform may<br>be added to the Bryonia. Deafness arising from obstructions of the<br>Eustachian tubes may be relieved by douching the passages with a dilute<br>tincture of Arnica flowers. H.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>ACCIDENTAL APPLICATION OF CROTON OIL</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>TO THE EYE.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>by wellington rose, m. d.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font2>A <span class=font1><b>very </b></span>respectable lady, of a plethoric habit, and sanguine temper-<br>ament, aged about 60 years, had for two or three years been afflicted<br>with an infirmity of her eyes. The sight was becoming dim and black<br>specks were apparently flying before them.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>She poured some Croton Oil from one phial into another, an some<br>of it adhered to one of her fingers, with which she indiscreetly rubbed<br>the eye which was the most affected. That eye and eyelid immediately<br>began to smart and burn very severely. Sw<sup>r</sup>eet cream was first applied<br>to it but gave no relief. Olive Oil was next used, and the pain soon began<br>to subside, and ere long all disappeared. The black specks also imme-<br>diately disappeared, and her eyesight has been more clear and strong<br>since the accident than it had been for a long time previous. This I nar-<br>rate as it may serve as a useful hint to physicians in regard to the treat-<br>ment of some diseases of the eye.</span></p>
