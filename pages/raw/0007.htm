<p><span class=font0>should escape into the stomach and bowels to produce the rice-water<br>discharges may be answered by referring to the inevitable result of severe<br>congestion of the lymphatics, as is also shown in the pouring out the<br>serum upon the surface of the skin in the excessive perspiration which<br>is sometimes present.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Tbe serum of the blood dissolves the epithelial cells of the alimentary<br>canal and these dissolved and partially dissolved cells are what gives to<br>the fluid its peculiar or ricy appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Is the cholera miasm, or <i>sui generis, </i>independent of the miasms which<br>produce other epidemic diseases ?</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Many physicians and natural philosophers have held that the cholera<br>miasm is but the product of the receding of some other form of disease<br>or rather a modification of a miasm which had produced some other<br>form of disease, and they have endeavored to sustain this position by<br>referring to the fact that an epidemic of cholera is usually preceded by<br>an epidemic of a different character. Others have considered that it<br>possesses an individual and independent character, unaltered by changes<br>and unaffected by climates, everywhere acting upon the alimentary canal<br>and on which, therefore, it must make its first impression.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Those who entertain this latter view consider the cholera miasm a<br>peculiar miasm, and call the cholera epidemic <i>the epidemic of epidemics<br></i>or .the producer of epidemics, and the cholera miasm the miasm of<br>miasms, or the producer of miasms.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>As has before been remarked, all miasms which produce epidemic<br>diseases have somewhat in common, but each also has something pecu-<br>liar or specific, and hence while the cholera has many characteristics<br>manifested in other epidemics, that it has an individuality of character<br>and an individuality of cause cannot well be denied.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The common characteristics which we observe in epidemics arise<br>from the fact that all miasms are of telluric and atmospheric origin,<br>and that all miasms in course of time have their power and influence<br>modified and changed. Yet they all nevertheless manifest essential<br>peculiarities of character and produce by a specific process each its own<br>individual disease. For instance, one miasm will produce scarlet fever,<br>another measles, and another cholera. If there is none of the specific<br>miasm there will be no measles, or no cholera, as the case may be.<br>Neither can one miasm produce another disease, for measles never pro-<br>duced cholera, or cholera measles, or anything else but cholera.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>This is the necessary result of the peculiar an <b>1 </b>specific character of<br>each individual miasm which possesses its own specific power and dis-</span></p>
