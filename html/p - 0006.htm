<p><span class=font0><i>Nature and Causes of Asiatic Cholera. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>In addition to the changes here specified others were noted but they<br>were supposed to be caused by the presence of some other modifying<br>disease, and hence not attributable to the cholera and not to be<br>accounted as a pathological result of the epidemic.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Pathologico-chemically, it was found that the blood was relatively<br>and absolutely poorer, or more deficient in water, having an appearance<br>resembling mud.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>It was also quite deficient in alkalinity, particularly in the tripple<br>phosphates, and the carbonate of soda. There was also often a defi-<br>ciency of the carbonate of ammonia which it is well known has equal<br>power to influence the coagulability of the blood and the integrity of<br>the red corpuscles.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>In all instances it was found that the cholera blood chemically was<br>closely allied to putrescent blood, and readily made to undergo the<br>putrefactive ferment, far more easily than healthy blood.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The evacuations were all found to be rich in water, and in the alka-<br>linity of which the blood was deficient, particularly the tripple phos-<br>phates and the carbonate of soda, while they contained but a trace of<br>albumen. Occasionally in the bladder would there be found a little of<br>the blue coloring matter mixed with chlorides and the earthy phosphates,<br>while under the microscope could be discerned in the sediment the tuff*<br>cylinders and the epithelium which had been discharged from the lining<br>of Bellini's small urin-ducts.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The secretions from other parts of the body have not been as care-<br>fully examined as they should be, but thus far have furnished only<br>negative results.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>If now we consider the changes produced in cholera as here described<br>are not always uniform, or of an equally marked character, but that they<br>depend upon the force of different influences—that epidemic cholera not<br>unfrequently occurs with entire absence of vomiting or purging, but<br>with an extraordinary amount of prespiratoy exudation, or with spams<br>that speedily cause death—that in spasmodic cholera the anti-spasmodics<br>are generally found useful—that not a few cholera patients die from<br>want of what is called reaction, even where there was no appearance of<br>decomposition of the blood or deprivation of serum in the blood vessels,<br>we must come to the conclusion that the first impression of the cause of<br>cholera is sometimes made upon the blood and at other times upon the<br>nervous system, while in more rare instances it may impress both the<br>blood and the nerves at the same time.<br>' The question as to why the serum or watery portion of the blood</span></p>
