<p><span class=font1>OBSERVATIONS ON THE USES OF SANGUINARIA<br>CANADENSIS.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>BY ABk'm. LIVEZEY, A. m., m. d.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>I</b><span class=font0><b>n </b></span>several medical journals I have taken the liberty to call the atten-<br>tion of the profession to some of the uses of our indigenous medicinal<br>plants, and in the present communication I beg leave to offer some<br>remarks upon the medicinal value of the Sanguinaria—a plaut inci-<br>dent to all localities and the root of which is easily gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Without prejudice to the use of any other article I feel warranted in<br>saying, from no little experience, that this plant with the aid of podophyl-<br>lin will exert a more happy influence in all hepatic derangements—both<br>as a cholagogue purgative and as an alterative—than any combination<br>of calomel.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Possessing undoubted nauseant, sedative and alterative properties,<br>blood-root will in cases of slight inflammation of the biliary organs, or<br>congestive states of the same, or where a species of spasmodic action<br>pervades those structures, give prompt relief; and where torpidity<br>exists and the physician thinks that the stimulant action of some mer-<br>curial is indicated he need only combine a minute portion of the<br>podophyllin to obtain all the advantages that are supposed to be<br>derived from calomel.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Sanguinaria gives a decided aid to the action of podophyllin or any<br>other cathartic to which it is added.   It is, in the form of tincture, an<br>alterative expectorant in chronic bronchitis.   It is valuable in chronic<br>hepatitis combined with ext. taraxicum and ext. podophyllum, jalap or<br>rhei, if obstinate constipation exists.    Tinct. Sanguinaria can with<br>advantage be substituted for wine of antimony in the <i>brown mixture<br></i>and wherever the wine of antimony is used.   As a substitute for the<br>compound cathartic pill the following combination—already published<br>will generally prove more satisfactory:<br>Podophyllin, gr. i.,<br>Leptandrin,   &quot; iv.,<br>Sanguinaria, &quot; ii.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Ext. Taraxicum, q. s.   Misce. ft. pil. No. iv.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Two or three for a cathartic ; <i>i </i>to a whole one night and morning as a<br>hepatic alterative.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>A graduate student of mine, Dr. Rice, late resident physician in the<br>W. C. Infirmary of Philadelphia, had a case of obstinate constipation<br>which had persisted four weeks—so said the patient, an^Irish woman,</span></p>
