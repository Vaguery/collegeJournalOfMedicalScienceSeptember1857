<p><span class=font0>In this as in every branch of the natural sciences, the conclusions<br>adopted may prove so clearly the hypothesis to be correct that it ceases<br>to be simply a hypothesis but may claim to be classed as an established<br>scientific truth. As in the natural sciences, so in medicine, the inquirer<br>after truth must at times adopt a hypothesis for the explanation of the<br>phenomena which he observes ; and in this instance the explanation<br>which the hypothesis of a cholera miasm gives to the phenomena of<br>the disease comes near proving that to be the true origin of the<br>epidemic.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>So also the later advances made in the science of chemistry have<br>nearly proved the cholera miasm to be a reality and not merely a<br>hypothesis. Dr. Horn of Munich, obtained from the atmosphere<br><i>Ozone, </i>or a negative electric body, and another body, <i>Todsomone,<br></i>which has been found to combine in the body with carbon and by the<br>combination to produce effects upon the structures very similar to the<br>effects produced under similar circumstances by the cholera miasm. I<br>would not assert that these discoveries prove beyond cavil that the<br>cholera miasm is Todsomone, but this much is certain that we may feel<br>sure that observation will establish many practical truths by accepting<br>this hypothesis, and will also stamp upon it the seal of truth.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Does the cholera miasm, as many suppose, make its direct impression<br>upon the stomach and intestines ?</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The circumstance that the first symptoms of cholera are vomiting and<br>purging, and other indications of derangement of the alimentary canal<br>goes to favor the idea that the mucus membrane of the prima vie is the<br>point at which the reception of the miasm first occurs and from which<br>it progresses farther into the organism. In opposition to this idea is<br>the fact that <i>spasmodic </i>cholera, as was observed in thousands of cases<br>in the epidemic of 1831, frequently destroys the patient before vomiting<br>or purging presents itself; and also the processes of vomiting and<br>purging removes from the system a large amount of fluid which chemi-<br>cal researches have proved to be changed blood serum, thus proving<br>conclusively that the vomiting and the purging are <i>secondary, </i>and<br>sequela to the primary changes which had occurred in the fluids. So<br>also is shown that the cholera miasm must have impressed several parts<br>of the system and not alone the alimentary canal. The nervous system,<br>the blood, the lungs, and the ganglionic system all bear evidence of the</span></p>
