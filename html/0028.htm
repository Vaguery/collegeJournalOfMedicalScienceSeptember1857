<p><span class=font1><i>Cincinnati Medical Observer. </i>Whether refusing to <i>exchange </i>will<br>satisfy the profession that the charges made in the <i>Observer </i>are without<br>foundation—are <i>malicious </i>and <i>false, </i>I cannot tell. The charge of false-<br>hood and malice must rest against the <i>Observer </i>and its correspondent<br>if anywhere, for my remarks as I have shown are almost a literal quota-<br>tion from its pages.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>TINCTURE OF GELSEMINUM IN DYSENTERY.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>by h. m. kaigler, m. d.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>B</b><span class=font0><b>eing </b></span>favorably impressed with the medical properties of the Yellow<br>Jessamine, from what I read concerning its uses in various diseases by<br>Dr. Mayes, of South Carolina, I give you these few lines to know of<br>you in what diseases you have used it most. Dr. Mayes made frequent<br>mention of you in writing the article. I used it in one case and it an-<br>swered my expectations beyond my most sanguine hopes. It w<sup>r</sup>as a case<br>of dysentery in which the pulse ranged from one hundred and forty to<br>one hundred and sixty; in twelve hours time the pulse fell to one hun-<br>dred and two beats. I gave it because I was fearful that if I gave the<br>veratrum it would in all probability give rise to cartharsis in my almost<br>exhausted patient. It was the first time 1 had ever given the Tine, of<br>Jessamine; its effects were those as described by Dr. Mayes, viz: dimness<br>of vision, double-sightedness, inability to open the eyedids, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>I at first gave twenty drops every three hours, afterwards increased it<br>to forty drops because of her dangerous situation. I prepared my tinc-<br>ture according to the formula of Dr. Mayes ; he put four ounces of the<br>root chopped fine in a pint of dilute alcohol and let it stand fourteen days;<br>he says from twenty to fifty drops is a dose. From his mentioning your<br>name as using the article largely in diseases, I address you to know<br>what is your manner of administering the medicine and in what dis-<br>eases do you think it will answer ? Do you think it a remedy that will<br>cure Gonorrhea ? Dr. Douglas of Chester, S. C, says it will cure the above<br>named disease ; he says he saw it used thirty years ago in that complaint.<br>I should like it very much if you would give me your view<sup>7</sup>s concerning<br>the article. We want something that will control the vascular system<br>without running any risk to our patient, as ia frequently the case in<br>using the Tincture of Yeratrum. The people in this part of the country<br>are so prejudiced against it that it is impossible to use it here, so we will<br>have to hunt up another remedy to use in its place.</span></p>
