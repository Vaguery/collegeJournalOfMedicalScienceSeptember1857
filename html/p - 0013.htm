<p><span class=font1>giving from one to three grains at a dose three times a day. In<br>troublesome cough he found it valuable. He also used it satisfactorily<br>in tinea capitis, tetter and other forms of skin disease in the form of<br>â–  powder or strong tincture on the affected part. He said: &quot;Of all<br>the articles in the Materia Medica, next to mercury and its preparations,<br>none in my opinion can compare with it in its powers to excite the<br>action of the liver, and it has the advantage of the former in its capa-<br>bility of being used at all times and continued without producing any<br>of its unpleasant results.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Dr. Bard in his Inaugural Dissertation confirmed the statement of<br>Dr. Downey in regard to the narcotic effect of the seeds and speaks<br>of using the root in croup, pneumonia, whooping-cough, phthisis and<br>jaundice. Dr. J. Allen of New York, says it powerfully promotes dia-<br>phoresis in inflammatory rheumatism. Dr. Downy says that the leaves<br>are used in veterinary practice in Maryland for the purpose of facilitating<br>the shedding of the hair of animals. Dr. Griffeths has also given it to<br>horses for the cure of bots, one or two roots serving to produce a cure.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Dr. Branch, of South Carolina, thinks a decoction of the root of<br>more value than any other single remedy in croup. He denies that it<br>is possessed of any poisonous properties.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>I have not been able to obtain the Inaugural Dissertation of Dr.<br>Henry West, of Belmont Co., Ohio, upon the use and value of this<br>agent, but evidently he must have placed a high value upon it to make<br>it the subject of his remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Recently Dr. J. W. Fell has been permitted to make a trial of his<br>mode of treating cancer on the patients of the Middlesex Hospital of Lon-<br>don and as he had not previously made known the agents he had used<br>the <i>London Lancet </i>condemned the secrecy which had governed him, and<br>finally Dr. Fell was led to publish a work on Cancer and its Treatment<br><i>I   </i>in which he said he had used the &quot; bruised bloody pulp of the white-<br>flowering puccoon.&quot;<br>I      The formula used by Dr. Fell differs from the chloride of zinc<br>paste of Dr. Papengurth and Prof. Hancke of Breslau and Dr. Canquoine<br>of Paris, from the addition of the blood-root to the ingredients used by<br>these surgeons in the treatment of cancer.   The formula is as follows :<br>Sanguinaria Canad., Sss, velgj.,<br>Zinci Chlorid., 3ss, velgij.,<br>Aqua, f3 ij.,</span></p>
