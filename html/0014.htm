<p><span class=font1><i>Observations on Sanguinaria Canadensis. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>ing granulations and other morbid growths, and it is more than proba-<br>ble the blood-root which has been added to various ointments and<br>applications which have been used upon cancerous affections has done<br>much toward effecting the cure.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>A reference to the use of blood-root in the cure of cancer is now<br>causing considerable discussion in various sections of the country, par-<br>ticularly in New<sup>7</sup> England, and where much is being said in regard to<br>who was the physician who first used it for the cure of cancer. My<br>own opinion is that it was in use by the people and the <i>country </i>phy-<br>sicians long before we have any record of its being thus applied.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>From the very imperfect abstract here given of a few of the articles<br>that have been published in our periodicals on the use of this root, we are<br>warranted in drawing the conclusion that it is a very valuable medicine<br>and should be introduced into more general use. But doubtless one<br>reason for its neglect is the fact that the root rapidly looses its value by<br>age and if kept more than one year may become nearly worthless.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The tincture and other preparations should be made from the root as<br>soon as possible after it is gathered and not from the old and nearly<br>worthless specimens usually sold by druggists.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>In regard to the preparations sold under the names of <i>Sanguinarin<br></i>and <i>Sanguinarina, </i>although I have had frequent letters of inquiry<br>addressed to me, I cannot give any satisfactory answer. I have no<br>means of knowing what these preparations are or how manufactured,<br>and of those who have used them I have never been able to obtain any<br>evidence of their character or value as therapeutic agents, but a friend<br>of mine who has manufactured these articles and sold them in considera-<br>ble quantities has told me, that as the result of his own observations<br>and the observations of those of the profession who, had bought and<br>used them, he was fully convinced they were of even less value than<br>the pulverized root. I consider it a duty I owe to the readers of the<br><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>to present these facts.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>If those who manufacture these agents would let us know enough<br>about them to warrant us in making a trial of them, and if those who<br>have used them would carefully observe their action and notify us of<br>the result, soon the readers of the <b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>would be in the possession<br>of the required information. In the present state of the case the only<br>answer I can give is that I have never used them and know nothing<br>positive about them. C.</span></p>
