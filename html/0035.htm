<p><span class=font1><b>T</b><span class=font0><b>hat </b></span>a State Medical Association, based upon correct principles and<br>sustained and conducted with the proper spirit, would be of great bene-<br>fit to the profession and to the community we have no doubt. Such an<br>institution w<sup>T</sup>ould do much in developing the resources of the healing<br>art, correcting errors in medical practice and establishing a high stand-<br>ard of qualifications as a criterion of professional respectability. We<br>are cons trained however, to say that such results from Associations that<br>have heretofore been organized we have not seen. In the old school<br>organization no rule has ever been adopted that has had the practical<br>effect of excluding ignorant and unworthy members who have tact<br>enough to maintain the claim of regularity <i>(i. e.), </i>subserviency to the<br>party dictum in regard to medical faith ; though their rules are potent<br>in ostracising any one, however learned^and accomplished, who has bold-<br>ness to think for himself and to express his thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>As some of our friends in different States are making the attempt to<br>form State Eclectic Medical Associations we deem it an opportune<br>season to speak a word of fraternal admonition on this subject. We<br>have no right—we have no desire—to dictate, yet since this is a matter<br>in which all are directly or indirectly interested and since we have been<br>repeatedly addressed on the subject, it will not, we hope, be deemed<br>arrogant in us to suggest, that an Eclectic Association formed at the<br>present time should take a position far above that occupied by those<br>to which we have referred. It should take a position that shall save<br>it from the odium of fostering and indorsing ignorance and charlatanry,<br>under the cloak of professional dignity, and which shall secure to true<br>merit a full opportunity of being appreciated and sustained. In short<br>an Eclectic Association should, if practicable, be composed of members<br>only who have thoroughly qualified themselves for their profession, and<br>whose object is, not to gain notoriety nor manufacture reputation for<br>themselves, but to mutually improve each other, and promote the com-<br>mon interests of all: of men who are willing and able to contribute by<br>their labors to the advancement of science, instead of making the<br>association bend under the weight of their self-vaunting ambition or<br>blush at the demonstrations of their ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>But here arises a question which must be met at the outset and<br>upon the judicious settlement of which greatly depends the reputation,<br>harmony and usefulness of the association. Who shall constitute the<br>body ?  Shall any one <i>claiming </i>to be a physician be admitted as a</span></p>
