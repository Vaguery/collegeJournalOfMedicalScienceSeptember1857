<p><span class=font3><b>R</b><span class=font2><b>emarks.</b></span><span class=font0>â€”</span>The use of blood as a remedial agent is not new to the<br>profession as a reference to the <b>J</b><span class=font2><b>ournal</b></span>, page 299 will show, where<br>Dr. Miller refers to the use made of it by Mauthner in ansemia, as<br>referred to by Dr. Davis, of Illinois, in the Transactions of the Illinois<br>State Medical Society for 1852, who says it may be given when inspis-<br>sated in doses of from ten to sixty grains at a dose, or dissolved in<br>water. The therapeutic use of blood is also referred to in the <i>Am.<br>Med. Journal </i>for 1853 and perhaps in other periodicals. But none of<br>these refer to the <i>styptic </i>properties it is supposed to possess by Dr.<br>Yan Buskirk, and which one single experiment neither proves or dis-<br>proves. The Pencil Savans are accustomed to deny nothing until it is<br>thoroughly disproved, and to admit nothing until it is thoroughly estab-<br>lished, but rather to <i>receive </i>the opinions of others and await farther<br>and full proof before their final disposition, and in this regard we may<br>do well to follow their example. <b>C.</b></span></p>

<p><span class=font3><b>A</b><span class=font2><b>mmonia </b></span><b>Y</b><span class=font2><b>alerianicum [ </b></span><i>Valerianate of Ammonia']. </i>This is formed<br>by the saturation of the Valerianic acid with the carbonate of ammonia.<br>It is usually a fluid, although an imperfect crystallization has been ob-<br>tained of the salt. In warm weather even the crystals are apt to de-<br>liquesce into a syrupy fluid, having a strong valerianic odor, and a<br>slight odor of ammonia.</span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>O</b><span class=font2><b>ttinger </b></span>of Munich, Germany, has highly recommended this prepar-<br>ation in Asiatic Cholera in the following form.</span></p>

<p><span class=font3><b>O</b><span class=font2><b>ttinger </b></span>used this mixture to the exclusion of every other internal<br>remedy, and after the severity of the attack had passed and reaction<br>was established, he gave but from four to six doses daily. He also<br>ordered ice to be rubbed over the abdomen externally, occasionally<br>changing the cold w<sup>r</sup>ater for hot or placing the patient in a hot bath in</span></p>
