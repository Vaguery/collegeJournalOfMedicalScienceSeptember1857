<p><span class=font1>Dr. Hamilton thinks that the method of treating fractures of the clavi-<br>cle recommended by Hippocrates, and adopted by Cel&#353;usand Dupuytren,<br>and approved by Drs. Eastman, Eve, Buck, and Post, of placing the<br>patient upon his back, w<sup>r</sup>ould result more satisfactorily than by the use<br>of any of the various appliances figured in the books.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>VIENNA AND ITS HOSPITAL.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>O</b><span class=font0><b>ur </b></span>readers will observe that our intelligent friends, Dr.'s T. <b>C. </b>and<br>L. E. Miller, frequently refer to their experience and their professional<br>friends in Vienna, and it may be of interest to know that Yienna, the<br>capital of Austria, contains about 500,000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The general Hospital was fouuded about one hundred years ago, by<br>the Emperor Joseph the II. It is the largest Hospital in the world,<br>the grounds embracing seven or eight squares, and is laid out in walks<br>shaded by rows of fine large trees.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Each square of ground is surrounded by a continuous line of build-<br>ings three stories high, and in all they contain 3,000 beds, which, how-<br>ever, are not always filled with patients, the usual number not averaging<br>more than from 2,300 to 2,500.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The clinics are held in this general Hospital, and usually there are<br>about 1,500 physicians and students in attendance on the clinics.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>In the lying-in, or obstetrical department from 8,000 to 10,000 births<br>occur yearly.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>In this city, with its University and Hospital, are presented admiral<br>and full opportunities for study and observation and we hope to pre-<br>sent to the readers of the <b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>information in regard to<br>professional matters, as they occur in this great city, probably in each<br>number we issue.</span></p>
