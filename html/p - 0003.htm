<p><span class=font0><i>Nature and Causes of Asiatic Cholera,</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font0>387</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Some also, have considered cholera to be caused by some derange-<br>ment of the chylopoietic vicera, but the anatomical and autopsical ex-<br>aminations have given no countenance to this conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The peculiar symptoms manifested in the asphyctic condition of<br>cholera has induced some to suppose that the whole difficulty arose<br>from a weakness or loss of functional power of the nerves, but more<br>especially of the spinal cord ; but the revelations of the dead-house<br>have not confirmed these conclusions and did much to disprove the<br>accuracy of the opinion entertained.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>More recently in their search for the seat and origin of cholera<br>physicians have been guided by what they have learned in regard to<br>the blood, its changes and decompositions, and they have observed that<br>in cholera there is a partial decomposition of the blood, with contem<br>poraneous alteration in the walls of the capillaries by means of which<br>the <i>serum sanguinis </i>in large quantities passes through their walls, or<br>is poured directly into the stomach and intestines, leading to the pro-<br>fuse vomiting and purging by which this serum is removed entirely be-<br>yond the organism. This decomposition of the blood and the outflow of<br>its watery portions is often produced with wonderful rapidityâ€”while<br>the more solid portions, as the red-corpuscles, is retained in the vessels,<br>and thus the fluid is rendered thick, dark and very liable to stagnation,<br>to clog up and produce congestion of the vessels. The thicK blood<br>also stagnates in the vessels of the skin, and causes the blue appearance<br>nearly always observed in that tissue. In the larger veins, and in the<br>brain, in the liver, and the spleen, and the lungs this stasis also occurs,<br>and hence the difficulty of breathing, the deafness, the aphonia, the<br>thirst, the scanty urine, the coldness and numbness, that accompanies<br>this disease.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Although this explanation is in accordance with the observations of<br>the profession, yet it may not satisfy all, for many deny that any ex-<br>planation can be given which shall prove satisfactory, and they desire<br>to know how it is, if the blood is realy separated, that a part of the<br>serum is not throwm into the cellular tissue, and not the whole of it<br>poured into the alimentary canal, or through the skin in profuse perspi-<br>ration. Why are not the pleural and abdominal cavities filled with this<br>fluid ? why is the patient not attacked with hydro-thorax and anasarca ?<br>are questions urged against this opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>There can be no doubt but the nerves which supply the vital force to<br>the walls of the blood-vessels are impaired during an attack of cholera<br>but those who entertained the opinion that the nervous power is dimin-<br>ished, are divided as to which is the <i>prime </i>cause of the difficulty, one</span></p>
