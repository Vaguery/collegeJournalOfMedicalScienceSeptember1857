<p><span class=font0><b><i>The Five Gateways to Knowledge; </i>by George Wilson, M. D , F. R. S. E., etc etc.,<br>Philadelphia, Parrt and McMillan. 1857.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>T</b><span class=font0><b>his </b></span>little volume receives a hearty welcome ; it is one of those rare<br>works we occasionally meet with in which the useful is combined<br>with the ornamental, and we find something in each page which will<br>amuse and instruct.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The style is simple and clear, and at the same time beautiful and<br>comprehensive. The dull monotony that too often characterizes such<br>works is not observable here, but each page is enriched with original<br>thought, clothed in language which the child may understand, and the<br>sage may read with pleasure.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The Author imagines himself standing sentinel to the city of the Soul<br>described by <b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ohn </b></span><b>B</b><span class=font0><b>cnyan</b></span>, and as he watched the five gates known<br>as the <sup>u</sup> Eye-gate, Ear-gate, Nose-gate, Mouth-gate, and Feel-gate,&quot; he<br>records all who bear tidings to the dwellers within.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Seldom have we seen so many of the truths of philosophy enriched<br>by the beauties of poetry. In his description of the Ear the following<br>occurs which we give as characteristic of the work.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><sup>u</sup> But music is never more delightful than when listened to in utter<br>darkness without obtrusion of music paper, or instrument, or perform-<br>ers, and whilst we forget that we have ears, and are content to be liv-<br>ing souls floating in a sea of melodious sound.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>We cannot recommend the work more highly than to advise our readers<br>to obtain and read it for themselves. <b>J.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b><i>The American Family Physician, </i>or Domestic Guide to Health. For the use of Physi-<br>cians, Families, Plantations, Ships, Travelers, etc. By John King, M. D., Professor of<br>Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children, in the Eclectic College of Medicine;<br>formerly Professor of Materia Medica, Therapeutics, and Medical Jurisprudence in the<br>Memphis Institute ; author of the American Eclectic Dispensatory, the American<br>Eclectic Obstetrics, etc., etc. Cincinnati, Lonqley Brothers, Publishers, 1857.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>T</b><span class=font0><b>he </b></span>above title-page, and several sheets of the above work have<br>been presented us by the Publishers, with the intimation that it would<br>be ready for sale in about a month.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>When the work is published we shall express our opinion upon its<br>contents and character; but for the present would simply refer to it<br>knowing that most of our readers are so well acquainted with the former<br>works of the Author as not to require any commendation of the one<br>forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b><i>The American Journal of Dental Science </i>for J uly.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>T</b><span class=font0><b>his </b></span>able advocate of the Dental profession is filled with valuable<br>matter, which it would be well for physicians, as well as dentists, to<br>become acquainted with.</span></p>
