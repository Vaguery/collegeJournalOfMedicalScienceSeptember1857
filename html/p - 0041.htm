<p><span class=font0><b><i>Domestic Medicine. </i>A Treatise on the Practice of Medicine, adapted to the Reformed<br>System, comprising a Materia Medica, with numerous Illustrations, By J. Kost, M. D.,<br>etc., etc., etc.   Cincinnati, R. Wilson, 1857.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>F</b><span class=font0><b>rom </b></span>the date upon the title page one would naturallv suppose this<br>book another recent addition to the literature of the Reformers in Med-<br>icine, but a cursory examination of the volume leads to the conviction<br>that it is a simple unchanged reprint of the work copyrighted by the<br>author some six years since.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Prof. Kost has written tw<span class=font0><b><sup>7</sup>0 </b></span>or three other works, which have had<br>a fair circulation, and has been engaged as a teacher in several<br>medical colleges, and hence the author and his productions are very<br>well known to the profession. In this work was embodied much of what<br>was known at the time it was written of the principles and practice of<br>that branch of medical reforms to which the author has been more in-<br>timately connected, and hence it is of interest as indicating the very<br>great progress <b>R</b><span class=font0><b>ational </b></span><b>M</b><span class=font0><b>edicine </b></span>has made during the past few years.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b><i>An Epitome of the American Eclectic Practice of Medicine; </i>embracing Pathology, Symptom-<br>atology, Diagnosis and Treatment. Containing also a complete list of the remedies used<br>by Allopathists, Hom≈ìopathists, and an Eclectic Pharmacy and Glossary. Designed<br>for Physicians, the Student of Medicine, and as a Domestic Practice for Families. By<br>William Paine, M. D., Professor of the Principles and Practice of Mediciue and Pa-<br>thology in the Eclectic Medical College of Pennsylvania. Philadelphia, H. Cow-<br>ferthwait and Co. 1857.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>F</b><span class=font0><b>rom </b></span>the many subjects embraced in this title-page we might natu-<br>rally expect a library of many volumes ; but instead the author has been<br>able to present what he had to&quot; offer on these important matters in a<br>single twelve-mo. volume of about four hundred pages. Whether our<br>Allopathic, Homoeopathic, Hydropathic, and Chrono-thermal neighbors<br>will think full justice has been done them in this little manual or not,<br>we cannot determine. We are sure, however, that physicians, students<br>and families will agree with us in regretting that the majority of the<br>subjects have been so briefly considered.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>We have repeatedly expressed our objections to the use of this class<br>of works for students and physicians, as tending to produce a careless,<br>indifferent or superficial consideration of matters of the deepest scientific<br>and humanitary interest, and a consequent empirical and unsuccessful<br>practice. But children usually creep before they walk, and walk<br>before they are able to run, and hence we may reasonably anticipate<br>these primal efforts to supply the profession with the demanded pro-<br>gressive literature will partake somewhat of a juvenility of character.<br>Even failures may, however, be considered successful in one point of<br>view, as the masts of sunken vessels serve as indicators of the pres-<br>ence and location of the rocks upon which they were stranded.</span></p>
