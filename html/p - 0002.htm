<p><span class=font0><i>Nature and Causes of Asiatic Cholera. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>It would prove fatiguing to the reader for me to enumerate all the<br>various hypotheses which have from time to time obtained in regard to<br>the etiology of cholera, and hence I shall only glance at a few of the<br>more prominent of them as prefatory to the opinions and conclusions to<br>which I have arrived.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>It has been observed that fat, and particularly the fats that are to be<br>found in diet where the food has become sour and rancid, will if eaten<br>often produce symptoms very closely analagous to cholera, and from<br>this observation the conclusion has been drawn that the cholera miasm<br>is one produced by a specific decomposition of animal tissues forming<br>a combination of gases similar to those evolved in the decomposition<br>of sausages, and which is known as the <i>sausage poison. </i>That this<br>view cannot be correct has become evident to nearly all.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Others have supposed that cholera is caused by what they have been<br>pleased to style the <i>cholera-mite </i>a supposed microscopic animalcule<br>diffused in vast quantities through the air, the food and the drink, and<br>that these animalcules are the <i>potentia nocens </i>of the disease. The<br>advocates of this hypothesis attack all other opinions and defend their<br>own with great violence, and are very strenuous in the advocacy of<br>what they assert to be the cause of cholera. Among those of this<br>class are many able microscopists, and yet they have neglected to bring<br>forward the only strong and indisputable evidence necessary to estab-<br>lish the accuracy of their deductions. They are unable to bring for-<br>ward any person who has been so fortunate as ever to have seen this<br>wonderful cholera-mite.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Not a few have directed their attention mainly to the stomach and<br>the intestines and think they find in the vomiting and purging the true<br>explanation of the cause of epidemic cholera; which cause to them is<br>the irritative and congested condition of the alimentary track. On<br>this hypothesis have they based their high estimate of the value of<br>opium and have viewed it as a specific against the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>This view of the matter is so superficial and so illy sustained by the<br>symptoms of the disease and the results of treatment that most have<br>abandoned it. All who have had any experience in cholera and its<br>treatment will have observed that the danger of the attack is by no<br>means proportionate to the activity of the vomiting and purging, but<br>that it frequently appears extremely severe and fatal where but little<br>vomiting or purging have occurred. But this class of persons have<br>their attention so closely drawn to their fancied seat of the difficulty<br>that they never perceive these facts and never have the faintest glimpse<br>of the true cause of the disease.</span></p>
