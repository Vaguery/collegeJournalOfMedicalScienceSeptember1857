<p><span class=font2>when she presented herself at the clinic—and in twelve hours time<br>she had a free alvine evacuation from the use of Sanguinaria, well tritu-<br>rated with white sugar and given in small doses every two hours.<br>Dr. R. is fully persuaded that blood-root is an admirable adjuvant in<br>all prescriptions for the restoration of healthful function in the liver,<br>and especially when constipation is coincident.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>N</b><span class=font1><b>ote</b></span><span class=font0>.—</span>Perhaps no indigenous plant has attracted more attention<br>from those physicians who are accustomed to notice the living speci-<br>mens of materia medica as they spring up in the woods and fields<br>than the one under consideration. The early appearance of its beauti-<br>ful and pure blossom, the dark blood-color of its fleshy root, its marked<br>taste and its prompt action on the system all lead to it3 obtaining the<br>attention which has been bestowed upon it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>A trial of its therapeutic virtues has led those who have made use of<br>it to speak of it in the highest terms of praise and to earnestly recom-<br>mend it to the favorable notice of the profession, and yet, strangely, it<br>has never obtained that prominent position in the list of medicines all<br>its advocates think it deserves.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Nearly every writer on Botany and Materia Medica in our country<br>has delighted to give a full description of this plant and to speak highly<br>in praise of its beauty and usefulness. Among the earlier writers who<br>have made mention of it Dr. Shoepf says that fifteen or twenty grains<br>of the pulverized root will produce powerful emesis, but that it must not be<br>given in the form of a powder as thus it is apt to produce great irritation<br>of the fauces. He prefers a decoction or the pill form. Merat says it<br>is useful in gonorrhoea. Shoepf also mentioned the value of a weak<br>decoction of the root in gonorrhoea and refers to the fact that Golden<br>had found it useful in jaundice. In doses sufficient to produce emesis<br>it was found to dislodge worms from the stomach. Thatcher, in his<br>Dispensatory, speaks of the use made of it by Dr. Dexter in doses of<br>one grain of the powder or ten drops of the saturated tincture, as a<br>stimulant and diaphoretic. Dr. Downy was of the opinion that the<br>dose as recommended by Drs. Shoepf and Colden was larger than could<br>be administered with safety. In speaking of the value of the root in<br>jaundice Dr. Thatcher says it was believed to be the chief ingredient<br>of the quack medicine known as <i>Rawsorfs Bitters.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font2>The younger Barton thinks that the only form in which the blood-<br>root should be used is that of a spirituous tincture. In this form he<br>used it in connection with the tincture of bitter-plants as a tonic with<br>great satisfaction. He also found it useful as a wash for old indolent<br>ulcers and sores with hardened edges and an ichorous discharge. He</span></p>
