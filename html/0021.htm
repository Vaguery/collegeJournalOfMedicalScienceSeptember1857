<p><span class=font1>HUMAN BLOOD A STYPTIC.(?)</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>by o. van buskirk, m. d.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>I </b><span class=font0><b>wish </b></span>to communicate a few thoughts upon a case which came under<br>my observation a short time ago, in which I employed human blood as<br>a styptic with the most gratifying result. To you this may be no new<br>thing, but to me it is, and it may be to many other junior members of<br>the profession. From this consideration I thought I would write you<br>a brief account of the case and the manner in which I employed it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The case was a lady from whom I extracted a tooth (the first molar),<br>and it was rather difficult to draw, but it came out whole and without<br>doing any perceptible damage to the jaw. The hemorrhage was not<br>very profuse at the time ; not more than usual. When she left my office<br>she seemed as w<sup>r</sup>ell as usual and continued so for two days, at which<br>time a profuse hemorrhage took place from the cavity in her jaw. By<br>means of a decoction of black-oak bark she checked it for about twenty-<br>four hours when it began again worse than before. I was then sent for<br>and found her quite weak and sick at her stomach. I applied geranin,<br>tannic acid, etc., all to no effect. I then took about two ounces of blood,<br>placed it over the fire and as soon as it came to the boiling point the<br>solid constituents of the blood coagulated, and left the aqueous portion<br>clear and limpid. I then poured off the water and left the other over<br>a slow fire until it assumed a thick, jelly-like form. I took a small lump<br>of this and filled the cavity and placed over it a small wad of cotton<br>wadding and directed her to close her jaws so as to keep the remedy in</span></p>
