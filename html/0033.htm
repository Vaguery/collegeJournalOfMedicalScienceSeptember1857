<p><span class=font0><i>Application of Croton Oil to the Eye.</i></span></p>

<p><span class=font0>mation of the eyes, which kept hirn from his business about two months.<br>He did not entirely recover from the disease this time, and in 1855<br>there was another acute attack w<sup>T</sup>hich lasted some four weeks, leaving<br>his eyes still affected. About a year ago his eyes became again sud-<br>denly inflamed, and the swelling and pain made him completely blind.<br>He was purged, bled repeatedly, cupped, blistered, and had a variety of<br>washes applied to his eyes, and treated on this plan of no plan until the<br>beginning of winter, when the lids were thickly studded with hard, irri-<br>table granulations, and similar hard and large granulations had sprung<br>up over the sclerotic conjunctiva ,and the pannus threatened to cover over<br>the entire cornea. There was much pain and intolerance of light, pro-<br>fuse lachrymation, and a free discharge of muco-purulent matter.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>He was leeched, the lids were scarified, purgatives were administered,<br>and the nitrate of silver applied regularly to the eyes for some weeks.<br>After this the nitrate of silver was alternated with the sulphate of cop-<br>per, and warm cataplasms were applied. After a time he improved<br>but did not get well, and soon there was a relapse.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>In April the attendant surgeon determined on inoculating the eyes<br>with the <i>virus </i>of <i>Gonorrhœa, </i>a Germanic transcendental mode of<br>treatment, apparently an offspring of the Hahnemannic school. The pa-<br>tient was not informed in regard to the nature of the virus of inoculation<br>but was told &quot;that it was a new preparation called <i>glandola.&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The introduction of the Gonorrhoea virus produced very violent in-<br>flammation. On the third day &quot;the lids were enormously swollen and<br>purple, and the whole side of the face and neck erysipelatous—the dis-<br>charge was excessive, and he w<sup>r</sup>as racked with intense neuralgic pain in<br>the eyebrow. There was, at this time, no possibility of seeing the globe of<br>the eye, in consequence of the extreme tumefaction and acute pain<br>where the lids were touched.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The after treatment consisted in washing the eye with lead water, and<br>a tw<sup>?</sup>enty grain solution of the nitrate of silver, an occasional purgative,<br>and morphia. After many weeks the eyes improved, the pupils were<br>free, the cornea had a soreness, and the sight was improving daily.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>We are half promised that the Surgeon who treated the above case,<br>will publish a paper <i>on the indications for inoculation, </i>and for one,<br>I should be pleased to have him show wherein his &quot;new preparation<br>called glandola&quot; is superior to the Croton oil mentioned by Dr. Rose.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>The European papers recently make frequent mention of this novel<br>mode of treating eye diseases, but it will take more than a European<br>reputation to commend the method to the favor of American Surgeons.</span></p>
