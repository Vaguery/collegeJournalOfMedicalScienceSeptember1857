<p><span class=font1>WHAT INFLUENCE HAS THE MOON UPON DISEASE?</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>by comely jessup, m. d.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>I <span class=font0><b>wish </b></span>to ask your opinion and procure, if possible, the result of the<br>observations of your readers, relating to the influence (if such influence<br>exist), exerted by the moon upon disease. I have been of the number<br>who look upon the lunar influences except such as may be attributed to<br>the known laws of gravitation as entirely fabulous, but several instances<br>occurring within the sphere of my observation, which have indicated<br>the existence of some hidden agency, a few of which have been dis-<br>tinctly marked, have awakened a desire to see the matter thoroughly<br>investigated and the truth or falsity of lunar influence fairly demonstrated.<br>The following are a few of the more marked instances of apparent lunar<br>periodicity which have fallen under my observation.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ase </b></span>1. Mr. <b>C, </b>aged perhaps 45, has been subject to epilepsy for<br>the last three years. About the time of the change and full of the<br>moon he will have from three or four to eight or ten convulsions. At<br>other times he is free from them, except occasionally about the time of<br>the first and last quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ase </b></span>2. T. L, aged 72, was attacked some four years since with ma-<br>lignant erysipelas, accompanied at first with paralytic symptoms,<br>which, together with a severe attack of &quot; Doctors, &quot;—though he sur-<br>vived them all—left him in a condition from which he has never re-<br>covered and never will. The most prominent features in his case now<br>are pain in the back and head, which is remittent in its character,<br>being most severe in the early part of the day ; nervousness, constant<br>trembling of the hands, or rather the peculiar shaking characteristic of<br>paralysis, to the extent that he can with difficulty feed himself; and<br>occasional attacks of general weakness and disposition to syncope.<br>These symptems are all much aggravated at the time of the moon's<br>changes.</span></p>
