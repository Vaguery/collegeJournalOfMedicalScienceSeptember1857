<p><span class=font2><i>Book Notices.&nbsp;</i><span class=font0>1 </span>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>&quot;We anticipate that Prof. Paine will be called upon to issue a second<br>edition of his work, and in anticipation of that event, we would sug-<br>gest that in regard to his nomenclature for remedies he may be able to<br>make some corrections of errors and introduce some improvements.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>In accordance with the usage of modern Chemists, all names of<br>Alkalies and Alkaloids should terminate with an <i>a, </i>as in Soda, Potassa,<br>Quinia, Morphia. The names of all Acids terminate in <i>ic, </i>as Acetic,<br>Tannic, Gallic, Sulphuric, Nitric. The names of all Resins and Resin-<br>oids terminate in <i>in, </i>as Resin, Rosin, Podophyllin, Jallapin. The<br>names of such agents as may belong to one of these four classes, but<br>whose character is as yet undetermined by scientific writers, are made<br>to terminate in <i>ine, </i>as Cornine, Santonine, Salicine, Piperine.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>In looking over the list of medicines named in this work we are sorry<br>to perceive that these simple and truly scientific rules have been disre-<br>garded. Hence we have &quot; Cinchona&quot; as the name of an alkaloid<br>principle, instead of Cinchona; &quot; Emetine&quot; denned as the alkaloid<br>principle of Ipecacuanha; &quot; MyriczV as an alkaloid; &quot; Quhmie,&quot;<br>and other similar errors, w<sup>T</sup>hich can readily be corrected in future editions.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>In conclusion we would cordially welcome, and heartily exert the in-<br>fluence of our <b>J</b><span class=font1><b>ournal </b></span>to assist all publications which are calculated to<br>enlighten and elevate the profession and advance the cause of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b><i>Remarks upon Aclhemy and the Alchemist, </i>indicating a method of discovering the tru&laquo;<br>nature of Hermetic Philosophy ; and showing that the search after the Philosopher's<br>Stone had not for its object the Transmutation of Metals. Being also an attempt to<br>rescue from undeserved opprobium the reputation of a class of Extraordinary Thinkers<br>in past ages. &quot;Man may not live by bread alone.&quot; Boston ; Crosby, Nichols, and<br>Company. 1857.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>S</b><span class=font1><b>ome </b></span>two years since, the writer of the present volume published a<br>small pamphlet on the subject of Alchemy, in which he presented the<br>idea that the <i>Philosopher's Stone </i>of the old Hermetic Philosophers<br>was not a supposed reality, but a symbol of <i>wisdom </i>or <i>truth.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font2>That pamphlet being designed solely for the friends of the author, was<br>never offered for sale. It attracted the attention of a writer in the<br><i>Westminster Review, </i>who did not aim at the same conclusion with<br>the pamphleteer, and hence the author was called upon to defend his<br>position. He therefore pursued his investigation by reading still<br>other works on Alchemy, and this farther investigation only confirmed<br>him in the opinion that although the Alchemists were the forerunners<br>of modern Chemists, yet their investigations were not mainly directed<br>to material matter, but that &quot;the <i>subject </i>of Alchemy was <i>Man; </i>while<br>the <i>object </i>was the perfection of Man, which was supposed to center in</span></p>
