<p><span class=font0><i>Observations on Sanguinaria Canadensis. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>had also used the powdered root as an application to fungoid growths<br>and nasal polypi. Bigelow, and Dr. Smith also used it for the same<br>purpose. So also Dr. Shanks and Dr. Israel Sterling, according to<br>Thatcher, used it in place of digitalis in coughs and pneumonic com-<br>plaints. Dr. Darwin has used it in peripneumonia trachealis in the<br>form of a decoction and from the benefit thence derived Dr. Barton<br>thought it must be a useful medicine, particularly in cynanche maligna,<br>in cynanche trachealis and other similar affections.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Drs. Barton and Downy said that the <i>leaves </i>of the puccoon as well as<br>the seeds are possessed of a <i>narcotic </i>power similar to that of the seeds<br>of the stramonium and that they had produced dangerous symptoms.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>In 1831 Daniel B. Smith published in the <i>Journal of the Phila-<br>delphia College of Pharmacy </i>a dissertation on this plant, in which,<br>he gives its natural and botanical history and speaks of the experiments<br>made by Dr. Dana on the root in 1824, when the <i>Sanguinarina </i>was<br>probably first obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Dr. Tullyhas carefully examined the medicinal powers of blood-root<br>and thinks it is therapeutically allied to squills, seneca, digitalis, guai-<br>acum and ammoniacum.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>More recently Dr. Williams, formerly of Massachusetts but now of<br>Illinois, has written several valuable essays on the Sanguinaria, but<br>unfortunately I have lost the reference to them and I only remember<br>that he considered it one of the most valuable if not the most valuable<br>of all the North American plants.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Dr. Thorn of Ohio, in a communication to the <i>Western Journal,<br></i>says that for two years he had been closely engaged in observing the<br>effects of this remedy in various diseases and he concludes that it is a<br><i>sedative </i>of no ordinary powers. For reducing the force and frequency<br>of the pulse without prostrating the system he considered it one of the<br>most efficient remedies. He also styled it an <i>alterative </i>with a marked<br>influence on the liver and the glandular system generally. He em.<br>ployed it in hemorrhage from the lungs, particularly in those cases where<br>the hemorrhage appeared to be caused by vicarious menstruation, and<br>considered it of more value than any other agent he had used.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>Dr. M'Bride in the <i>South. Jour, of Med. </i>said he considered this<br>plant eminently serviceable in those disorders of the liver where the<br>secretion of the bile is either<sub>fc</sub>suppressed, deficient or vitiated. In im-<br>perfect convalescence after bilious fever he says, &quot; the puccoon iu the<br>best remedy.&quot; As an emmenagogue he thought highly of it. He<br>recommended it as a substitute for mercury.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><sub>t</sub> Dr. J. L. Mothershead used it in dyspepsia in the form of pills,</span></p>
