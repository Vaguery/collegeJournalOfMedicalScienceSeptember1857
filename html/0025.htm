<p><span class=font1><i>Notes and Observations, by </i><b>D</b><span class=font0><b>r. </b></span><b>M</b><span class=font0><b>iller.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>409</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>ÏdematoTis, acute, almost sudden swelling of the leg, and the one half<br>of the external genitals and the glands in the groins. It does not<br>affect both legs at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Many consider the swelling to be the result of a metastasis of the<br>milk, and hence the popular name; others think it a disease of the<br>lymphatics originally, and others think the veins to be the original<br>seat of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>But the majority now hold it has its origin through and in conse-<br>quence of the inflammation of the crural vein, and resulting in the<br>obliteration of the same. I agree with <b>L</b><span class=font0><b>ebert </b></span>that it is caused by a<br>checking of the venous circulation from an obstruction in the veins.<br>We find the disease mostly in those women who have suffered great<br>loss of blood by venesection or hemorrhage and in those who take cold<br>during the confinement.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The prognosis has always been very favorable under the treatment<br>which I adopt.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>I always enjoin quiet, and wrap up the affected leg in roasted meal<br>and afterwards in oil-cloth. I give only the mildest salts, as Bochelle<br>salts for the purpose of evacuating the bowels, or use injections for<br>the same purpose, and give effervescing powders. As soon as the<br>febrile excitement has passed or is diminished I allow an easily digested<br>and nourishing diet, with Tonics, and the sub-carbonate of Iron. As<br>soon as the swelling becomes Ïdematous I consider the disease on the<br>decline.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Dr. ScnRiMER, from his experience, as well as many others, was led<br>to the opinion that a careful tonic and sustaining treatment is the best<br>in Phlegmasia dolens alba and soon results in a cure. He states that<br>in an obstinate and severe case which followed a severe, tedious labor,<br>with extensive loss of blood, that, under what is styled the <i>antiphlo-<br>gistic, </i>or depleting treatment, the disease grew continuously worse, but<br>so soon as mild fomentation was applied, and a solution of Iodide of<br>Potassium and iron, given internally, the cure was speedily effected.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>[N</b><span class=font0><b>ote</b></span>. A somewhat different opinion, and the reasons therefore as<br>regards the nature and origin of this disease, may be found in Prof.<br>King's <i>American Obstetrics. </i>C]</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>S</b><span class=font0><b>ummer </b></span><b>C</b><span class=font0><b>omplaint</b></span>. In <b>27 </b>cases I have speedily arrested the dis-<br>ease in from 4 to <b>12 </b>hours, using in some cases the <i>Compound powder<br>of Rhubarb, </i>and in other cases I have used only the <i>Nitrate of Bis-<br>muth </i>combined with a little Bhubarb.</span></p>
