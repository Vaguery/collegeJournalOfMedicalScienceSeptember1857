<p><span class=font1><b>1857.1</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><i>Abortion—The Medical Observer.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>411</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>of this city lias extended I consider the charge a base slander, but as I<br>am not on intimate terms with the members of that Faculty I cannot<br>answer for them and I leave them to endure the odium the charge has<br>cast upon them or prove its falsity as they see fit.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Being unwilling to allow such a charge as that contained in the<br><i>Observer </i>to rest upon the profession, I expressed my full conviction<br>that it was a &quot;base slander,&quot; leaving those more particularly interested<br>to answer for themselves, for while I would ever do all I can to sus-<br>tain the reputation of the profession, I would not presume to be bet-<br>ter acquainted with the character and practice of Dr. Bauer's friends<br>than he is.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>But hardly had the ink become dry on the pages of the <b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal</b></span>, ere<br>I received the following <i>public document, </i>made intentionally public by<br>being sent in the form of an <i>open circular </i>through the City Post-Office.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><i>&quot; Office of the Cin. Med. Observer.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>A</b><span class=font0><b>ugust </b></span><b>15, 1857.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Dr. <b>C</b><span class=font0><b>leaveland.—</b></span><i>Sir.</i>—As you are fully aware—the allusion to<br>Dr. Bauer, in your article on <i>&quot;Abortion&quot; </i>in the Aug. No. of the<br><b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>is grossly and inexcusably false; and the personal<br>reference to his friends here are as intensely malicious—as unwarrant-<br>ed ;—the <i>&quot;Observer&quot; </i>therefore declines further exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>E</b><span class=font0><b>dward </b></span>B. <b>S</b><span class=font0><b>tevens.&quot;</b></span></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>During the present, &quot;heated term&quot; many have found it difficult to<br>keep up an equipoise of temperature, but I am of the opinion that the<br>publisher of the <i>&quot;Observer&quot; </i>must now have as much internal as<br>external caloric, and according to the Thomsonian notion he is on<br>the high road to health and happiness. In regard to the &quot; No. 6 &quot; the<br>&quot;Composition,&quot; and the &quot;Capsicum &quot; which he has introduced into<br>his prescription, since he has manifested a great familiarity with them<br>I shall leave the readers of the <b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>to decide if the terms <i>'&quot;false&quot;<br></i>and &quot; <i>malicious&quot; </i>do not rather belong to those who publish the &quot; <i>Ob-<br>server </i>,&quot; and write letters, and not to myself.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>I have stated no falsehood, but cannot tell whether Dr. Bauer has<br>or not. I have made no &quot;malicious&quot; accusation against the Editors of<br>the <i>Observer, </i>or the former Faculty of the Miami Medical College. &#9830;<br>Neither have I allowed the use of the <b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>of which I am pub-<br>lisher or any other to do the same. Both the <b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>and<br>its publisher have ever done what they could to sustain the char-<br>acter and the reputation of the profession, and both can possibly survive<br>the terrible catastrophy of the threatened loss of &quot; exchange&quot; with the</span></p>
