<p><span class=font2><i>Queries Answered. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>QUERIES ANSWERED.<br><span class=font1><b>&quot;catarrh.&quot;</b></span></span></p>
<p><span class=font2>I <span class=font1><b>will </b></span>make the following query to which I would be pleased to get<br>an answer in the next No. of the <b>C</b><span class=font1><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font1><b>ournal</b></span>. I am annoyed con-<br>siderably with noises in my ears, it being however almost entirely confined<br>to the left one. Sometimes the noise is of a ringing'character; at others<br>there is a roaring and rushing. It is almost constant, yet frequently<br>more marked in the evening and aggravated by every slight cold I take.<br>I have no pain in the ears but sometimes a slight itching ; I have been<br>very subject to irritation of the larynx from the slightest check of perspi-<br>ration. My tonsils also were formerly irritated and somewhat en-<br>larged, but by means of astringents and stimulants locally applied they<br>were reduced and have not given me any trouble for some months. My<br>general health is good, but I have been somewhat troubled with papular<br>eruptions on the face. I have at times felt more or less dizziness when<br>raising my head suddenly after having bowed down ; and not long since,<br>after having taken a slight cold, the noise was greatly augmented in my<br>ear and I became quite dizzy and for a short time (after a somewhat full<br>meal), was unable to walk straight. My hearing has-been slightly affected.<br>Now what is most probably the difficulty and what course of treatment<br>would you recommend % I might have mentioned that I never had acute<br>inflammation of the ear either external or internal, nor have I been sub-<br>ject to headache.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>A</b><span class=font1><b>nswer.</b></span><span class=font0>Ñ</span>Your annoyances probably arise from chronic inflammation<br>of the mucous membrane of the nares and pharynx ; the &quot;ringing&quot; in the<br>ears is produced by a partial obstruction of the Eustachian tube, preven-<br>) ting a free passage of air from the throat to the ear. The laryngeal diffi-<br>culty depends upon the same disease which is continued into the vocal<br>organ ; and the dizziness is consequent upon a congested state of the ves-<br>sels of the head, the blood being determined thither in undue quantities<br>by the irritation existing'in and about the pharynx. The disease, in the<br>acute form called &quot; coryza&quot; and &quot; influenza&quot; is a common one, especially<br>in countries subject to great atmospheric vicissitudes.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>The lower animals are subject to a similar disease. It is well known<br>that within the heads cf mammalia there are extensive pneumatic cavi-<br>ties communicating with the mouth and nose. These cavities in man<br>are called, &quot;antrums,&quot; as that of Ilighmore ; and &quot;sinuses,&quot; as the fron-<br>tal, ethmoidal and sphenoidal sinuses. The elephant and the owl derive<br>considerable reputation for intellectual profundity from the prominence<br>given by these airy cells.   Pneumatic cavities in the bones of birds</span></p>
