<p><span class=font2><b>4()8&nbsp;</b><i>Notes and Observations, by </i><b>D</b><span class=font1><b>r. </b></span><b>Miller</b>. [September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>T</b><span class=font1><b>yphoid </b></span><b>F</b><span class=font1><b>ever.</b></span><span class=font0>—</span>A late German writer, Dr. F. C. Miller, says in<br>regard to the treatment of Typhoid Fever:</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>&quot; The general recommendation of starvation and depletion by the<br>French School will never lead us Germans to adopt their extreme notions<br>however high they are lauded. We shall never as practitioners of<br>medicine, become Red Republicans on the sufferings of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>It is true with us there are some who pass encomiums on Calomel as an<br>abortive remedy in this form of fever, yet others who view the disease<br>and that agent from a <b>R</b><span class=font1><b>ational </b></span>point of view'know mercury at the<br>best is a deceitful agent, and sometimes proves very disadvantageous<br>and greatly destructive.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>The typhoid process sometimes proceeds rapidly and with great<br>severity, but mainly through dietetical and therapeutical errors. The<br>obstruction of the bowels which is often present in the commencement<br>of the disease, may by the injudicious use of laxatives or cathartics<br>be changed to a severe or unmanageable diarrhoea. Many physicians<br>have, by ordering purgatives, made it necessary to also order a coffin.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>The treatment for Typhoid Fever adopted by the physicians of<br>Vienna seldom embraces either Emetics, Cathartics, or Venesection.<br>They give an infusion of a few grains of Ipecacuanha in the congestive<br>or nervous stage, together with Chlorine water, and a little dilute<br>Aromatic Sulphuric Acid in the evening, and where there are severe<br>exascerbations, with any appearance of intermittance they give about<br><i>four </i>grains of Sulph. Quinia daily. For the diarrhoea they prescribe<br>Alum. When the skin remains presistently hot, arid there is great<br>prostration, particularly if there is profuse diarrhoea they give camphor<br>and alum by the mouth and in injections.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>If the disquiet and restlessness continues, but is more marked dur-<br>ing the night, and especially if there be a bloody diarrhoea, they give<br>Musk and Camphor in injections. They also apply as indicated, cold<br>water to the head and cold washings to the whole body, made of equal<br>parts of water and vinegar, so long as the skin remains hot and dry.<br>For the purpose of hastening convalescence they lay great stress upon<br>tepid bathing. This course I consider progressive and Rational treat-<br>ment.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>P</b><span class=font1><b>hlegmasia </b></span><b>D</b><span class=font1><b>olens.</b></span><span class=font0>—</span>This disease is known by the names of White<br>Leg, Swelled Leg, Milk Leg, White Swelling of Lying-in Women,<br>Phlegmasia dolens alba. <i>Obstructus venerarum puerperalis.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font2>We find this a disease of lying-in women, and it commences sooner<br>or later with febrile excitement, and a painful, bright white, strained,</span></p>
