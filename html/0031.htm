<p><span class=font1>The horse is subject to attacks of acute inflammation of the membrane<br>lining these cavities, and among farmers the disease is called &quot; horse<br>distemper.&quot; The inner structure of the horns of kine is liable to take<br>on the same disease, and then it has the appellation of &quot; horn-ail.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Considering that a large portion of the human face is taken up with<br>antrums and sinuses, all lined with a membrane extending from the nasal<br>cavities, it is not surprising that &quot; coryza&quot; and &quot;catarrh&quot; so often pre-<br>vail. Existing in the chronic form, the symptoms of catarrh become<br>somewhat varied and complicated. From sympathy of continuity the<br>disease extends itself through the nasal duct and the lachrymal canals,<br>and affects the conjunctiva, which, together with a congestion of the<br>vessels about the origin and along the course of the optic nerves, inter-<br>feres with vision. The patient is unable to read or use the eyes upon<br>minute objects, for much time, without dimness or a blending of objects<br>being the result. Hearing is impaired in a manner before hinted at,<br>and the patient is often treated by pretending &quot;aurists&quot; with appli-<br>cations to the external ear, leaving the real cause entirely overlooked,,<br>while any laryngeal trouble is nursed as &quot; bronchitis.&quot; Frequently the<br>congested state of the lining membrane of the frontal sinuses will pro-<br>duce headache, which is mostly confined to the region over the eyes and<br>about the temples—nervous headache, the patient calls it—and it is apt to<br>recur periodically, once or twice a day. A feeling of heat and pressure<br>at a point half way between the crow<sup>T</sup>n and forehead, directly ov'er the<br>sphenoidal sinuses, is not uncommon. There is a dry, unpleasant sensa-<br>tion in the anterior nares, and by dilating these openings the septum nasi<br>will be observed redder than natural. The patient feels a disposition to<br>&quot; hem&quot; in]order to relieve the fauces and a quantity of mucus mixed with<br>globules of the same in a more condensed form will be brought into the<br>mouth by the effort. Every morning the throat has to be cleared of<br>&quot; phlegm&quot; by coughing and other efforts. In several cases mucus finds<br>its way down the oesophagus, exciting nausea and favoring accumula-<br>tions of gases in the stomach ; and from the proximity of the heart to the<br>stomach its functions are interrupted, causing the patient at night some-<br>times to spring from bed as though suffocation were about to result from<br>a heart disease.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The treatment of chronic catarrh, as given by authors, is meagre and<br>unsatisfactory in its results. By many physicians the disease is pro-<br>nounced incurable, yet they recommend their patients to snuff up the<br>nose cold water and use astringent gargles.   Fumigation by directing</span></p>
