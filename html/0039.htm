<p><span class=font1>Society. This offer of <b>a </b>prize has led to an animal competition among<br>the best writers of the country, which competition has brought forth<br>some very valuable Essays upon Medical topics of great practical im-<br>portance.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The two Essays now issued in this volume were first printed in the<br><i>American Journal of Medical Science, </i>and from its pages have they<br>been reprinted for the purpose of presenting them to the profession in<br><b>a </b>more permanent form, and giving them a more extensive circulation.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>After presenting the opinions of the most eminent pathologists in<br>regard to <i>the nature of pulmonary tuberculization, </i>Dr. Lee comes to<br>the conclusion that &quot; tuberculization is a disease depending upon an<br>alteration of the blood from its normal condition.&quot; * * * &quot; Princi-<br>pally caused by suppression or diminished action of the functions of the<br>skin and a deficiency of the red corpuscles, and that consequently it<br>should not be considered as merely a local disease but requires to be<br>treated with reference chiefly to the disordered condition of the blood<br>and to the causes which have been instrumental in producing it, before<br>it has arrived at so advanced a stage as to preclude all rational hopes<br>of recovery.&quot; * * * &quot;It is therefore against the diathesis, or the<br>cachectic state of the system, and not against its local manifestations<br>that our remedies should be directed.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>In regard to the <i>effects of climate, </i>in the treatment of tubercular<br>diseases, the author presents many valuable facts which he has embodied<br>in twenty separate cases.   He says :</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>&quot; 6. The chief indications in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculi-<br>zation by means of climate, are first to remedy as far as possible the<br>morbid condition of the blood which constitutes the cachectic state, and<br>by this means to prevent or arrest the formation of the morbid pro-<br>duct ; and secondly, to allay the general and local excitation caused by<br>the organic lesion. These indications are not unfrequently opposed to<br>each other and in many cases the practitioner is obliged to restrict him-<br>self to endeavoring to fulfill the second, and to palliate the symptoms<br>by pharmaceutical remedies.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Although much has been said of late in favor of a high northern<br>latitude, and Dr. <b>K</b><span class=font0><b>ane </b></span>has expressed the opinion that no one living<br>among the Esquimeaux will be likely to die of pulmonary tubercular<br>disease, Dr. <b>L</b><span class=font0><b>ee </b></span>does not seem to have had his attention drawn to this<br>matter.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>In regard to Jhe <i>influence </i>of <i>pregnancy, </i>which is the subject of Dr.<br><b>W</b><span class=font0><b>arren's </b></span>Essay, much has been said and yet but little of a reliable charac-<br>ter has been recorded, except in scattered fragments and isolated remarks.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Dr. <b>W</b><span class=font0><b>arren </b></span>commences his essay with a quotation of the opposing</span></p>
