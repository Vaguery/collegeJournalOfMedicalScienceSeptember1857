<p><span class=font2>1857.&nbsp;<i>Tincture of Gdseminum in Dysentery.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>R</b><span class=font1><b>emarks.</b></span><span class=font0>â€”</span>I am pleased to know that my efforts to extend a knowledge<br>of this agent are already successful to a considerable extent, and I<br>gladly respond to the request for farther information.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>In regard to the value of the Tincture in Gonorrhoea I am not at<br>present prepared to advance an opinion, as neither my own experience<br>or that of my friends, has presented a sufficient amount of results on<br>which to base any absolute opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>In regard to its use in other diseases, perhaps it will be found to be<br>possessed of other properties in addition to its power as a sedative to<br>the heart, which will prove it to be of great value in many instances.<br>The splanchnic system of nerves doubtless govern the secreting organs,<br>as well as the processes of chemical change and nutrition, and when<br>these functions, as well as that of circulation are performed too ac-<br>tively, great harm may result and the agent which is capable of<br>moderating, checking or controlling these changes, may be found to<br>possess more valuable remedial properties than have been heretofore<br>suspected.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>In the article quoted by Dr. Mayes, I said : &quot; I am satisfied that as<br>a sedative to the nerves branching from the spinal cord and going to<br>the organs of locomotion, or the nerves of voluntary motion ; and in a<br>lesser degree to the vagus and sympathetic nerves that are distributed<br>to the heart and lungs, inducing a less powerful and less frequent pulse,<br>and a more sluggish and feeble respiration, the Gelseminum will prove<br>highly satisfactory to any who may give it a trial.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>I also accord wdth the remarks made by Dr. Mayes, as quoted in the<br><b>J</b><span class=font1><b>ournal</b></span>, p. 187, except that I think as the agent impresses, as has<br>been stated, the <i>Exito-Secretory </i>nerves, it is capable of diminishing their<br>undue activity, as in Gonorrhoea and Dysentery and other forms of un-<br>due activity and excitability of those nerves, and hence it will prove<br>not only a valuable adjuvant to other treatment, but also a direct rem-<br>edial agent of no inconsiderable value in a very large number of dan-<br>gerous and painful diseases, including inflammations of the brain, the<br>lungs, the pleura, the viscera and in rheumatism, and various disorders<br>of the fluids of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>But before we can determine the actual value of this potent agent<br>we need the results of many carefully made trials of it, cautiously noted^<br>and frequently repeated, and we hope to be favored with these from<br>all who have made such observations and have noted the results ob-<br>tained. C.</span></p>
