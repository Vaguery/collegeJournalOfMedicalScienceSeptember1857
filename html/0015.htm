<p><span class=font1>EXTRACTUM NICOTIANLE RADEMACHERL</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>by theodore c. miller, m. d.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>I <span class=font0><b>herewith </b></span>present a notice of an agent which to me is possessed of<br>extreme value. It is the <i>extract of the Nicotiania rustica, </i>as prepared<br>by the late Dr. T. G. Rademacher.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>It is not prepared from the dry but from the fresh and green tobacco<br>plant. In preparing the extract it is necessary that <i>immediately </i>and<br>without delay, after the leaves have been pulled they must be pressed<br>so as to force out the juice and that juice evaporated to the consistency<br>of an extract. When prepared in this manner the extract has none of<br>the taste of the dried tobacco leaves ; but if the leaves are pulled only<br>a few hours before the juice is expressed, then the extract will have a<br>taste more or less like that of smoking tobacco, in which case it is not<br>fit for therapeutical purposes. I have ahvays found it best to have the<br>leaves pressed at once on being pulled ; and I have always prepared it<br>according to the directions of Rademacher, from the Nicotiania rustica,<br>and not from the Nicotiania tabacum. Rademacher's extract is one of<br>the best remedies in genuine cough of the lungs, and for that I can wdth<br>a clear conscience recommend it to the readers of the <b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal.<br></b></span>It is a remedy for which probably I could not find a substitute.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Rademacher gave it in doses of from one half to two grains, and re-<br>peated it several times a day. It may be made into a pill with the<br>powdered marsh mallow root. It is a quick and safe remedy in a par-<br>ticular diseased condition of the lungs for which I am not able to give<br>a name, but the want of the <i>name </i>is no loss to the practical physician,<br>who must be governed by the nature of the disease and not by its<br>nomenclature.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>That we can, with the extract of the fresh leaves of tobacco, cure an<br>inveterate genuine lung cough, and thus prevent pulmonary tuberculosis,<br>in my mind does not admit of a doubt, provided the cough is kept under<br>the control of the remedy. But there are forms of lung cough which<br>this extract will not control, and in those cases I would recommend a<br>trial of the <i>Stibium Sulphuretum Auranticum, </i>as mentioned in the<br><b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>for June, page <b>351. </b>Rademacher truly says : &quot;In<br>general we must be guided in our minds in the practice of our art, by<br>the following fact: The diseases are not governed or changed in char-<br>acter by the ideas and opinions of the physician, but the opinion of<br>the physician must be governed by the nature of the disease.&quot;</span></p>
