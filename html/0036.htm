<p><span class=font0><i>State Medical Associations. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>member, irrespective of professional attainments? The vast number<br>of ignoramuses who are to be found throughout the land professing to<br>be &quot; doctors,&quot; might furnish such an association with a formidable roll<br>so far as numbers are concerned, but we can readily conceive of such<br>an organization, with which no man who had any self-respect or any pro-<br>fessional reputation to lose would willingly be identified. But by what<br>means shall the ignorant and unprincipled be excluded ? We fear it<br>will be difficult to do it successfully by any rule. Shall <b>a </b>diploma be<br>a sure passport to membership ? Many men hold diplomas who have<br>very little claim besides to professional character, and who by obtaining<br>such documents knowing their own incompetency, have proven them-<br>selves to be unworthy of confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>It seems however that there is no practicable criterion of member-<br>ship that is so nearly equitable as one having reference to graduation.<br>A diploma from <b>a </b>legally authorized Medical College with the usual<br>number of chairs filled by reputable professors, and requiring the usual<br>amount of study and collegiate instruction as <b>a </b>prerequisite to gradua-<br>tion <i>should </i>be prima facie evidence of respectable professional attain-<br>ments ; and although there are diplomas which have been issued by<br>institutions claiming to be respectable, in the hands of men every way<br>unworthy, the admission of such w<sup>T</sup>ould certainly be a less evil than to<br>admit in addition to these the legions of pretenders who have neither<br>diplomas nor medical education. We know that such a rule would ex-<br>clude some who are far above mediocrity as successful and scientific<br>practitioners, but such could soon obtain diplomas, and if they are men<br>of professional spirit they would be willing to suffer temporary incon-<br>venience for the sake of excluding the unworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>If we had the drafting of a constitution we should probably incor-<br>porate at least four rules bearing on membership, embodying the fol-<br>lowing principles:</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>1.&nbsp;A voting member must be <b>a </b>graduate of <b>a </b>legally constituted<br>Medical College that requires the usual curiculum of study before grad-<br>uation.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>2.&nbsp;</b>Whenever it should appear that a member had obtained his<br>diploma without complying with legal requirements he should be ex-<br>pelled.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>3.&nbsp;No one who professed to possess knowledge which he would not<br>impart to the profession, or who practiced with or encouraged the sale of<br>secret nostrums, should retain his membership.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>4.&nbsp;Reputable non-graduates should be eligible by vote of the associ-<br>ation to the position of honorary membership, with the privilege of<br>participating in the deliberations.</span></p>
