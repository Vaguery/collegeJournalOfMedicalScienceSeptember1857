<p><span class=font2><i>Notes and Observations, by </i><b>D</b><span class=font1><b>r. </b></span><b>M</b><span class=font1><b>iller.</b></span></span></p>

<p><span class=font2>which had been dissolved from one ounce to one ounce and a half of<br>caustic potash. Many other physicians have tried these remedial<br>measures for the treatment of Asiatic cholera and have spoken highly<br>of it.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>M</b><span class=font1><b>ichael </b></span><b>Y</b><span class=font1><b>on </b></span><b>Y</b><span class=font1><b>isanik </b></span>speaks in regard to this mode of treatment<br>in the following manner : &quot; A very favorable result has been procured<br>by the Yalerianate of Ammonia,by adding a scruple to three ounces of<br>distilled w<sup>r</sup>ater. We tried it in <i>sixteen </i>selected dangerous cases, of<br>wdiich one third showed already symptoms of asphyxia. We gave in<br>the beginning one tablespoonful every quarter of an hour, but aftei<br>the system became affected with the remedy w<sup>T</sup>e gave the medicine<br>each half hour or every hour. After twelve or fifteen hours, and the<br>use of a few doses of the medicine, the pulse which before could not<br>be felt would appear again, the discharges and the cramps would cease,<br>and the skin would acquire its natural color, elasticity and feeling,<br>become moderately moist, and the patient present a tendency to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>As soon as the use of the remedy had produced a turgescence of the<br>face, and symptoms of congestion of the brain were presented, we<br>ceased to longer use the valerianate, and by lifting the head up and<br>applying cold water these symptoms were checked. In this w<sup>T</sup>ay, of<br>the sixteen patients we saved <i>ten, </i>and <i>five </i>died. One case could not<br>be made to take the medicine. Others have complained that their<br>patients could not be made to retain the medicine, but our experience<br>convinces us that the remedy is one deserving every attention, and<br>should be recommended for further trials.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>B</b><span class=font1><b>leeding in </b></span><b>P</b><span class=font1><b>regnancy.</b></span><span class=font0>—</span>The celebrated author and practitioner,<br>Dr. K. G. Neumann, expresses himself in regard to bleeding in preg-<br>nancy in the following manner:</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>&quot; While pregnant women do not continue to menstruate, some old<br>women of either sex in and out of the profession have imagined that<br>impurities must accumulate in the system unless <i>bleeding </i>is resorted to<br>to furnish the desired outlet. These imaginings are certainly foolish,<br>and while we can excuse women for entertaining them, we certainly<br>cannot excuse physicians for entertaining and perpetuating this folly.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Such physicians should, as often as they bleed pregnant women,<br>have several pounds of their own blood drawn off, so that they should<br>soon die for the benefit of humanity. The blood which is supplied by<br>the vital forces is required for the formation and perfection of the fœtus,<br>and it is a <i>crime </i>to waste it, and thus rob the unborn innocent of its<br>most precious patrimony.&quot;</span></p>
