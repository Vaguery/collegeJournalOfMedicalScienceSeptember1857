<p><span class=font1><i>^|&nbsp;Booh Notices. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>maxim of the Homœopathists, <i>&quot;similia similibus curantur&quot; </i>and the<br>Allopathic one of <i>&quot;contraria contrariis curantur&quot; </i>of Hippocrates<br>and his followers, and adopts the Allopathic doctrine as having its<br>foundation in reason, embodying the plain, practical, logical view <i>of<br></i>the subject, and being sustained by the experience of a vast majority of<br>the most scientific men in every country.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Dr. <b>W</b><span class=font0><b>arren </b></span>says: &quot; The causes of phthisis may be properly divided<br>into two classes :   1. General causes.   2. Special causes.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Among the most prominent of the general causes he names <i>heredi-<br>tary predisposition, </i>and considers the fact that it is an hereditary<br>affection <i>as prima facie </i>evidence of its <i>nervous </i>origin. He next con-<br>siders the influence of improper aliments, the influence of impressions<br>made on the skin, and lastly, those impressions on the nerves connected<br>with the <i>emotions. </i>Of these latter he enumerates <sup>tl</sup> the gratification<br>of lust, indulgence in onanism, depression of spirits, violent grief, and<br>indeed all passions whereby immediate depression or subsequent reac-<br>tion is induced ;&quot; quotes from Lombard, Moreton, Laennec, Hippocrates,<br>Dupay, Amestoy, Wood and Williams, in support of this proposition.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Among the <i>special causes </i>of the disease he names various callings,<br>improper clothing, suppression of habitual discharges, and various dis-<br>eases which tend to direct an unusual amount of blood upon the pul-<br>monary tissues.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>In his second chapter Dr. <b>W</b><span class=font0><b>arren </b></span>endeavors to prove that there is<br>an <i>antagonism </i>between the development of tubercle and the state of<br>pregnancy, and to do this he <i>assumes </i>that in pregnancy there is a dis-<br>position to the establishment of <i>inflammatory action, </i>which is so immi-<br>nent as to demand &quot; the production of certain methods of relief to the<br>economy, whereby its normal condition may be secured and retained,&quot;<br>and enumerates loss of blood, nausea, vomiting, disgust for food, etc., as<br>the means required for &quot;the perfection of nature's most important work.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The final conclusion of the author is so clearly presented in the clos-<br>ing paragraph of his Essay that we quote it entire:</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><sup>u</sup> I have thus attempted, by arguments, facts and authorities, to<br>prove that pregnancy prevents the progress of phthisis, even when that<br>disease is perfectly developed. Whether this effort has been successful<br>or not, must be left to the judgement of my readers ; and to them I<br>- confide my cause, with the full assurance not only that their decision<br>will be equitable in regard to all that has been urged in support of my<br>position, but that they will agree with me in the conclusion that if<br>pregnancy can arrest the progress of consumption when fully established,<br>then for a still stronger reason it must &quot;retard the development of<br>tubercles in those predisposed to phthisis.&quot; <sub>s</sub></span></p>
