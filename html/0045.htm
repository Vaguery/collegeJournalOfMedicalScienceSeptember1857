<p><span class=font0><b><i>Demand of the Age on Colleges.</i>—Speech Delivered by the Hon. Horacb Mann, President of<br>Antioch College, before the Christian Convention, at its Quadrennial Session, held at<br>Cincinnati, Ohio, October 5, 1854.   New York.   Fowler and Wells, 1857.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>T</b><span class=font0><b>his </b></span>is the product of a Master Mind, governed by a Master Will,<br>which leads to a bold, fearless enunciation of whatever is considered as<br><i>truth, </i>particularly those truths which have a bearing upon the spiritual<br>or physical welfare of the human race.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Those who give utterances to <i>positive </i>and more paiticularly <i>original<br></i>ideas, are apt to find far more opponents than followers at first, and<br>hence, probably, but few will be ready to take the same views as our<br>author on the first perusal of this little work, and yet most will read it<br>the second and the third time, and whether they adopt the opinions<br>advanced or otherwise, they must be benefitted thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>We most earnestly wish that such Speeches as this and the Address<br>to the Students of Antioch College, which is added as an Appendix,<br>together with the <i>Address to the Students of the Eclectic College of<br>Medicine, </i>by Prof. I. <b>J. A</b><span class=font0><b>llen</b></span>, M. D., L.L. D., a part of which was<br>published in the <b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>in March last, could be read by every<br>Medical Student in the land.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>That our readers may judge of the character oC this Speech, we<br>make the following brief extracts:</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>&quot; Let me say, then, in a single sentence, that our hope and aim is to<br><i>meet not merely the advanced, but the advancing Demands of the Age.<br></i>What, then, does the age demand that our College should be ? or rather,<br>in the first place, w<sup>T</sup>hat does the age demand that it should not be ?</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>&quot; It should not be an Egyptian pyramid, for the preservation of old<br>mummies, literal or psychological. Whatever has vitality in it, what-<br>ever has truth in it, these let us religiously preserve, for Truth is endued<br>with immortal youth and beauty, and can give forever and to all with-<br>out self-exhaustion or impoverishment. But as for the mummies, let<br>the Arab peasants continue to burn them, as travelers tell us they are<br>now accustomed to do, for cooking their dinners. Would to Heaven<br>that all the tyrants of the preseŋt day, political and mental, could be<br>put to as good a use.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>&quot;Dugald Stewart likens some of the literary institutions of his time<br>to old hulks sunk in the stream, which by their stationary position<br>show to the passers-by how far the living have advanced beyond the<br>dead on the Biver of Progress. We do not desire to enter into any<br>competition with those old hulks for the honor or repose of their con-<br>servatism. Among the moral surveyors who are measuring the onward<br>march of mankind, we would aspire to be found among the foremost<br>chaiubearers, pressing right forward in defiance of any obstacle, and<br>up any a eclivity; and let those who come after keep the tally.</span></p>
