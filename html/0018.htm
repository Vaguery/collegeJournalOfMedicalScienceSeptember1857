<p><span class=font3>PLEURITIS, LATANT.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>BY C. e. WriHAM, M. D.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>P</b><span class=font1><b>leuritis </b></span>is a disease which often presents obscure, important and in-<br>teresting complications, taxing the utmost skill of the experienced phy-<br>sician in tracing the precise bearing and extent of the morbid action<br>established.</span></p>
<p><span class=font3>The heart, lungs, bronchia and liver are often implicated in this disease.<br>Asthenic pneumonia, and chronic and latent pleuritis have many com-<br>mon symptoms. It is stated that pleuritis is more prone to produce<br>tubercular disease than pneumonia is, and it is thought by some authors<br>that the absorption of pus into the blood may explain this rather sin-<br>gular fact. In .the treatment of disease our object should be to remove<br>morbid action by the most simple and effectual treatment the case will<br>admit of. If the following report should be the means of stimulating<br>the young practitioner to a more thorough study of thoracic diseases I<br>shall be amply rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span class=font3>On the 11th of June, 1856, F. W., a lad 14 years of age was presented<br>for my advice. He was of a sanguine temperament, and a tw<sup>T</sup>in brother.<br>I had never seen him before, but from his father gained the following<br>history of his case. Five months previous to calling upon me he sud-<br>denly lost the power of speech; did not know that he had previously<br>suffered from cold or exposure. The loss of speech was the first symp-<br>tom of disease he could recollect and this was not preceded by any<br>very marked indications of hoarseness. A low, hoarse and painful<br>whisper was the result of all his efforts at conversation. This condition<br>continued for one month when to his surprise and great joy he found<br>himself complete master of his vocal organs and congratulated himself<br>on so strange and unexpected a recovery. He said that while making<br>some slight exertion he felt something give away in his chest and im-<br>mediately he could talk as well as ever. At the end of one week he<br>w<sup>r</sup>as again deprived of speech in the same unexpected and sudden man-<br>ner. His physician after inspecting his throat, but making no other<br>examination, prescribed a gargle of &quot;pepper tea&quot; saying it would soon</span></p>
