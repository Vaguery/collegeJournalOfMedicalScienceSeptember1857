<p><span class=font1><i>Abortion—The Medical Observer. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>ABORTION—THE  MEDICAL  OBSERVER AND<br>ITS PUBLISHER.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>by prof. cle a vel and.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>I</b><span class=font0><b>n </b></span>the last <b>C</b><span class=font0><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>in answering a querie in regard to the<br>most effectual method of producing abortion, I made some remarks in<br>regard to a statement published in a medical journal of this city, which<br>has led to such a curious specimen of <i>Epistelation </i>that I am induced<br>to refer to the matter, and favor the readers of the <b>J</b><span class=font0><b>ournal </b></span>with the<br>letter alluded to.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>. It is well known to the profession in this city that sometime since<br>Louis <b>B</b><span class=font0><b>auer</b></span>, M. D., of Brooklyn, New York, gave one or more lectures<br>to the profession, in the Miami Medical College of this city ; and that<br>while here, ho was on intimate relations with the editors of the <i>Cin-<br>cinnati Medical Observer.</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>After his return to the East the <i>Observer, </i>in March last, published a<br>communication from him, in which he made some remarks upon the<br>frequency wdth which he had been &quot;requested to assist ladies in procur-<br>ing abortion.&quot; Other circumstances he also stated, which led him to<br>suppose the production of criminal abortion is of not unfrequent occur-<br>rence, and referred to a lady wdiose &quot;death seemed to be connected with<br>criminal abortion.&quot;   He continued, page 106 :</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>&quot; Since then we have read and heard a good deal of similar instances<br>and trials in which medical men were implicated, <i>and in a large city<br>of the West the medical men with whom we happened to come in<br>contact, indulged in conversation that led us to the belief that the<br>procuring of abortion was one of their daily and most lucrative<br>engagements, in which even men occupying honorable distinction in<br>the ranks participated&quot;</i></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>In reference to this charge against members of the profession thus<br>published and circulated in the <i>Medical Observer, </i>in my article, I<br>said:</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>&quot; Some months since a physician from the East visited this city and<br>gave one or more lectures, by invitation, before the friends of one of<br>the Medical Colleges in this city. He was on intimate friendly terms<br>with the faculty of that College, and after his return to Brooklyn he<br>published a letter in which he charged upon those with whom he had<br>associated that their conversation led him to suppose that the unlawful<br>murder of unborn infants was a common occurrence with them and a<br>lucrative business.   So far as my personal knowledge of the profession</span></p>
