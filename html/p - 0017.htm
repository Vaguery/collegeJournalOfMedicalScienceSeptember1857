<p><span class=font1>1857.]&nbsp;<i>Extraclum Niootiani≈ì Rademacheri.&nbsp;</i>* 401</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>** As I was at the time out of the extract of tobacco I made a trial of<br>the Lobelia, but I obtained some from my brother and about two<br>weeks since I commenced its use. In six days the cough and the expec-<br>toration entirely ceased. I have since visited the patient and although<br>the symptoms are so much relieved, auscultation does not promise much<br>for the final recovery &lt;?f the patient. Too many persons had prescribed,<br>and the lungs are too much diseased to allow much hopes of a permanent<br>cure; but this case illustrates the power of the agent.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>I am the more urgent to induce the profession to make a trial of<br>this extract, as I think it is nearly or quite unknown to the physicians<br>in this country.</span></p>
<p><span class=font0><b>aqua  nicotians tabacum  sperituos^] radamacheei.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>This preparation is recommended highly in affections of the brain<br>accompanying fever, in <i>rheumatismus acutus fixus at vagus, </i>in other<br>affections of the brain and spinal marrow, in cholera morbus, and in<br>cholera Asiatica.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>To prepare it: Take of choice fresh green leaves of Nicotianse ta-<br>bacum eight pounds, and cut them finely. Add of the best alcohol,<br>by weight one and a half pounds, of distilled water as much as is<br>necessary to distill over eight pounds (by weight) of the water.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The leaves are to be cut and the distillation effected immediately<br>after they are pulled, with great care that there shall be no over-heating<br>of the liquid, as, if the liquor be over heated it will have a very dis-<br>agreeable odor of tobacco, which it does not have when the water is<br>properly prepared.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Eademacher uses this water in every stage of the Asiatic cholera.!<br>In the earlier stages he gave the following:</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Aqua Purse, f 3 vij.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Soda Acet., 3 jss.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Aqua Nicotian., f 3j.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Gumi Arab., 5ss.<br>M.   Dose, one table-spoonful every hour.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The great majority of cases treated with this mixture recovered<br>immediately from the attack. In those cases where the attack was fol-<br>lowed with a typhoid condition, he gave:</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Tinct. Ferri Acetici, f 3 j., ''.[</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Aqua Nicotian., f 3j.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Aqua Puree, f 3vj.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Gumi Arabici, 3.<br><b>M.   </b>Dose, one tea-spoonful every hour.</span></p>
