<p><span class=font3><b>418&nbsp;</b><i>Caution—An Attempt at Fraud. </i>[September,</span></p>
<p><span class=font0>f&nbsp;<span class=font3>CAUTION—AN ATTEMPT AT FRAUD.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>O</b><span class=font2><b>n </b></span>making inquiry this morning at one of our first class book-seller'a<br>for the English edition of &quot;Gregory's Chemistry,&quot; I was offered a<br>book which, on examination, I found to be curiously mutilated, viz:<br>the title page had a strip of white paper very neatly pasted over a<br>portion of it, which piece of paper upon close examination I found an.<br>swered the purpose of concealing the fact that the book was published<br>under the editorial care of one <i>J. Milton Sanders, M. D. </i>To this attempt<br>at concealment on the part of the book-seller or publisher (I care not<br>which), I feel it my duty to call the attention of the profession. I also<br>wish to notice the fact that those having the work to sell feel ashamed<br>of the so-called &quot;reprint&quot; of Prof. Gregory's excellent w<sup>r</sup>ork, yet are<br>attempting by this contemptible trick to avoid the influence of the<br>many severe, though just notices the work as edited by Sanders has re-<br>ceived. I would call the attention of the reader to the notices on pages<br>82-3 4 and 232-3 of the present volume of the <b>C</b><span class=font2><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font2><b>ournal.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>J. </b>F. <b>J-</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font3><b>N</b><span class=font2><b>ote</b></span><span class=font1>—</span>Although I was prepared for almost any attempt at deceiving<br>the profession by the American Editor of Gregory's Chemistry, I was<br>not inclined to allow a statement like the above to rest solely on the<br>authority of the writer of the above communication, every way worthy<br>of entire belief as I know his statement to be ; hence I went to the<br>book store where this work was offered for sale, and on examination<br>I found it was the old edition which W. II. Derby &amp; Co. of this city,<br>had copyrighted.</span></p>
<p><span class=font3>The honorable proprietor of the book store viewed this attempt at<br>deception as any honorable, high-minded man must, and offered his<br>assistance in determining the extent to which the mutilation had been<br>carried and the fraud perpetrated.</span></p>
<p><span class=font3>If the repeated instances of deception of the American editor and<br>the publishers of Gregory's Chemistry should lead the readers of the<br><b>C</b><span class=font2><b>ollege </b></span><b>J</b><span class=font2><b>ournal </b></span>to renewed interest in the book, I would refer them<br>to the <i>American Journal of Pharmacy </i>for Jan. last, page 89 <i>et Seq.<br></i>and to the <i>American Journal of Arts and Sciences </i>for March last, for<br>a more extended reference to this subject. We should feel it our duty<br>to say much more in regard to these frequent attempts at deception<br>on the part of the individual referred to above, were we not aware that<br>our readers are fully acquainted with the character of the party engaged<br>in the fraud. C.</span></p>
