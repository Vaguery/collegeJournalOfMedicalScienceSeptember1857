<p><span class=font1><b>421</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font1>As we have already said, we have no desire to dictate to our medi-<br>cal brethren, but having been asked for our views on this subject we<br>have, as in duty bound, endeavored to give a succinct statement of them.<br>We will close this article by saying that we sincerely hope that Eclectic<br>physicians everywhere, whether members of associations or not, will<br>take and maintain high ground in opposition to every form of impos-<br>ture in medicine, and demonstrate to the world that the Ethics as well<br>as the medication of our branch of the profession is an improvement<br>upon that of the old school party.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1><b>the eclectic college of medicine,<br>It </b>is with pleasure that we announce to the friends and patrons of this<br>College that the Trustees have added to its former advantages the halls,<br>fixtures and furniture of the American Medical College, which recently<br>occupied part of the same edifice. They have also secured the services<br>of a full Faculty who will reside in the city. Whether Prof. Buchanan,<br>Emer. Prof, of Cerebral Physiology and Institutes of Medicine, who<br>resides in Louisville, Ky., can spend any time with us during the session<br>or not, we cannot say, though we hope he will be able to do so. The<br>Trustees and Faculty have, however, deemed it due to him who has so<br>long and efficiently labored for our cause and whose sympathies are still<br>with us, to retain his name in an honorable position in the Announce-<br>ment of the College.</span></p>

<p><span class=font1>One writes that the same apparatus has been in use some years, and<br>is sold in New York under the name of &quot; Bush's clavicular apparatus,&quot;<br>but that Dr. Wheedon has made an improvement by constructing the<br>rods of two parts—extensible—so as to fit persons of different heights.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>Dr. Hamilton says : &quot; The use of a <b>T </b>splint, as a dressing for a broken<br>clavicle, is certainly as old as the days of Heister, who, in his great w<sup>r</sup>ork<br>entitled <i>Institutiones Chirurgicœ, </i>published at Amsterdam in <b>1839, </b>has<br>given a description and an engraving of this apparatus as it was then<br>used by himself.&quot;</span></p>
