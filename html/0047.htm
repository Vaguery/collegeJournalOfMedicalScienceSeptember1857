<p><span class=font0><b>ABSTRACTS.</b></span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>E</b><span class=font0><b>pilepsy.</b></span><span class=font1><b>Ñ</b></span>Dr. Eobert Hunt maintains that an abnormal excess of<br>alkali in the blood directly predisposes the nervous system to disease<br>and not only this but that it also causes various chemical changes in'<br>the blood, which result in the generation or retention of noxious matters<br>in the system, which excite a tendency to spasms and convulsions. In<br>epilepsy, where there is an uniform deficiency of organic principles, as<br>urea, and an excess of mineral matters, especially chloride of sodium,<br>in the urine, they have some connection w<sup>7</sup>ith the state of the blood and<br>the disease in question, and in such cases he has effected cures by keep-<br>ing the bowels regular, administering twenty drops of diluted nitro-<br>muriatic acid two or three times a day, before meals, with the use of a<br>dilute nitro-muriatic acid bath every night, remaining in it 15 or 20<br>minutes each time; subacid fruits are to be used freely.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>H</b><span class=font0><b>emoptysis.</b></span><span class=font1><b>Ñ</b></span>The only remedies to be trusted in severe cases are oil<br>of turpentine, gallic acid, chloride of sodium, or nitre with digitalis;<br>alum is not sufficient to meet the danger. Blood-letting temporarily<br>arrests the bleeding, but is dangerous, owing to the debility and increased<br>susceptibility to the intercurrent affections it gives rise to. In using the<br>gallic acid or turpentine in severe cases we should first procure a transient<br>check of the hemorrhage by ligatures to the limbs and ice to the chest,<br>allowing the internal means to consolidate this temporary cure.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>H</b><span class=font0><b>emorrhagic </b></span><b>D</b><span class=font0><b>iathesis.</b></span><span class=font1><b>Ñ</b></span>Give full diet: mutton chop, eggs, milk,<br>etc.; as a medicine, gallic acid five grains, dilute sulphuric acid twenty<br>minims, decoction of cinchona an ounce and a half, mix for a dose; to<br>be repeated three or four times a day. If the hemorrhage be from the<br>mouth, apply turpentine with a sponge three times a day. If the surface<br>of the skin be extensively ecchymosed, give dilute sulphuric acid 20<br>minims, sulphate of iron four grains, sulphate of magnesia half a drachm,<br>infusion of columbo an ounce and a half; mix for a dose, and repeat<br>three times a day. Should there be restlessness, give at night muriate<br>of morphia one-third of a grain, lactucarium four grains.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>B</b><span class=font0><b>right's </b></span><b>D</b><span class=font0><b>isease.</b></span><span class=font1><b>Ñ</b></span>Liquor Ammoniae Acetatis, by acting on thelskin<br>and relieving the congested condition cf the kidney, has been found the<br>best of all remedies for this disease ; diuretics at the same time to be<br>strictly avoided, but solvents may be used.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2><b>P</b><span class=font0><b>iles.</b></span><span class=font1><b>Ñ</b></span>When associated with protrusion of the rectum, may be<br>treated with nitric acid ; it is much safer and quite as effectual <b>a<br></b>remedy as the ligature or knife, and there is much less danger from<br>phlebitis.</span></p>
