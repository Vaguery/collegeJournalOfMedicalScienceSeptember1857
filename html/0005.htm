<p><span class=font1>1957.]&nbsp;<i>Nature and Causes of Asiatic Cholera. </i>389</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>as <i>cholera spasmodica ; </i>while in other climates, vomiting and purging<br>are the most prominent features of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>It is' also important, in the investigation of the cause of cholera, to<br>learn to distinguish between the genuine cholera and other forms of<br>disease, as well as to decide what results are produced from cholera<br>and what from other causes, and it is only those who have had consid-<br>erable experience in this disease who can always make this distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>The pathologico-anatomical, and the pathologico-chemical results of<br>the disease coutribute largely to the knowledge requisite to determine<br>the cause and nature of it, and they therefore must never be neglected<br>or overlooked. The post-mortem examinations and the examinations<br>of the secretions and excretions must be made, particularly the secre-<br>tions and excretions of the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, the stomach,<br>and the intestines, but more particularly the excretions of the kidneys,<br>and on the results of these examinations may we base our own view<sup>7</sup> of<br>the nature and cause, as w<sup>r</sup>ell as of the treatment of the diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class=font1>During the last epidemic the post-mortem examinations have fur-<br>nished in general and in particular, the same results as those obtained<br>during former epidemics. The skin of those who died of the disease has<br>been cyanotic, or blue colored, particularly the skin over the extremities.<br>The vessels in the sinuses and meninges of the brain have contained<br>much thick dark blood. The inner meninges have been congested, with<br>ecchymoses. The brain itself has been firm, and on intersection has<br>disclosed similar ecchymoses in its substance. The pleura and pericar-<br>dium, and all the serous membranes have a slippery feeling, showing a<br>separation of the delicate lining from the subjacent parts, and covered<br>with a glutenous albuminoid fluid. The lungs are dry and of a clear<br>red, and bloodless. The heart, particularly the left ventricle has been<br>drawn up, and in it and in the large vessels we have found a thick<br>black, tarry blood possessing little or no power of coagulation. The-<br>liver is pale, and the gall-bladder filled with much dark bile. The<br>spleen is usually enlarged, dark red-brown, and its enveloping mem-<br>brane thrown into wrinkles. The stomach and intestines are filled up<br>with a rice-watery, or a bloody colored fluid, with the mucus membrane<br>of the stomach swollen and injected. The epithelium of the intestines<br>in nearly the whole extent is dead, and rubbed off; the mucus mem-<br>brane red, and the follicles swollen. The kidneys in most instances<br>presented distinctly the changes which are found in the disease known<br>as <i>morhus Brightii. </i>This changed condition was particularly found in<br>those who had died of that form of cholera known as the <i>cholera-<br>typhus.   </i>The bladder was found contracted and empty.</span></p>
