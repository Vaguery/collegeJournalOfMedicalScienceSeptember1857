<p><span class=font2>effect a cure; but after a trial of several weeks this prescription was<br>discarded, as no change had resulted. Lancinating pain would occasion-<br>ally be felt in the chest, slight cough, expectoration streaked slightly<br>with blood. He continued to perform light work and had not been<br>confined to his bed. I found him presenting the following symptoms<br>five months after the first appearance of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>The mucous membrane of the pharynx presented a pale and debili-<br>tated appearance ; the chest inclined forward, the body assuming a<br>stooping position; great tenderness of the spine from the first cer-<br>vical vertebra to the last dorsal; pressure over the lungs, liver, stomach<br>and spleen gave pain. In short no part of the chest nor abdomen<br>could be percussed without revealing deep-seated tenderness. The<br>skin was dry, pulse quick ; there w<sup>T</sup>as much dyspnoea with abdominal<br>respiration. Percussion of the lungs gave rather a dull sound. Bowels<br>torpid. I diagnosed the disease to be Latent Pleuritis complicated<br>with chronic inflammation of the larynx which gave rise to the Aphonia.<br>As the patient was of a strumous diathesis and the disease of long stand-<sup>5<br></sup>ing I doubted the efficacy of treatment but advised it and took charge<br>of the case on the 12th of June.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>I first ordered morning bathing to be practiced daily, the water used<br>to be impregnated with chloride of sodium and bicarbonate of potassa.<br>Internal treatment:</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>#   Podophyllin, 3ss., <span class=font0>x</span></span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Capsicum, gr. X.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Ext. Taraxicum, q s.<br>M. f. Pill, No. X.   Take one of these pills morning, noon and night<br>until the bowels are freely moved, then take but two a day.</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Comp. Syr. Stillingia, fSiij.,</span></p>
<p><span class=font2>Iodide of Potassium, 3j.<br><b>M. </b>Take one teaspoonful four times a day. To test the progress of<br>the case I saw the patient daily. I discovered no change until the third<br>day; the bowels were then active, less tenderness about the cervical<br>vertebra, could whisper with less pain and more distinctly. On the<br>fourth day still more improved. I ordered the same treatment continued<br>and on the next day the patient recovered full power of speech and could<br>talk freely and without pain. He continued to improve and on the tenth<br>day of treatment I could discover no abnormal symptoms. Percussion<br>over the abdominal and thoracic viscera was no longer painful; no ten-<br>derness of the spine could be detected. I now discontinued the former<br>treatment excepting one pill to be taken each day, and prescribed the<br>following:</span></p>
