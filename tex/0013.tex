troublesome cough he found it valuable. He also used it satisfactorily
in tinea capitis, tetter and other forms of skin disease in the form of

<span class=font1>Dr. Bard in his Inaugural Dissertation confirmed the statement of
Dr. Downey in regard to the narcotic effect of the seeds and speaks
of using the root in croup, pneumonia, whooping-cough, phthisis and
jaundice. Dr. J. Allen of New York, says it powerfully promotes dia-
phoresis in inflammatory rheumatism. Dr. Downy says that the leaves
are used in veterinary practice in Maryland for the purpose of facilitating
the shedding of the hair of animals. Dr. Griffeths has also given it to
horses for the cure of bots, one or two roots serving to produce a cure.</span>

mode of treating cancer on the patients of the Middlesex Hospital of Lon-
don and as he had not previously made known the agents he had used
the <i>London Lancet </i>condemned the secrecy which had governed him, and
finally Dr. Fell was led to publish a work on Cancer and its Treatment
<i>I   </i>in which he said he had used the &quot; bruised bloody pulp of the white-
flowering puccoon.&quot;
I      The formula used by Dr. Fell differs from the chloride of zinc
paste of Dr. Papengurth and Prof. Hancke of Breslau and Dr. Canquoine
of Paris, from the addition of the blood-root to the ingredients used by
these surgeons in the treatment of cancer.   The formula is as follows :
