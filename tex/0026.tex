<FONT?><b>I</b><FONT?><b>n </b>the last <b>C</b><FONT?><b>ollege </b><b>J</b><FONT?><b>ournal </b>in answering a querie in regard to the
most effectual method of producing abortion, I made some remarks in
regard to a statement published in a medical journal of this city, which
has led to such a curious specimen of <i>Epistelation </i>that I am induced
to refer to the matter, and favor the readers of the <b>J</b><FONT?><b>ournal </b>with the
letter alluded to.

Louis <b>B</b><FONT?><b>auer</b>, M. D., of Brooklyn, New York, gave one or more lectures
to the profession, in the Miami Medical College of this city ; and that
while here, ho was on intimate relations with the editors of the <i>Cin-

criminal abortion."   He continued, page 106 :

procuring of abortion was one of their daily and most lucrative
engagements, in which even men occupying honorable distinction in
the ranks participated"</i>

<FONT?>In reference to this charge against members of the profession thus
published and circulated in the <i>Medical Observer, </i>in my article, I
said:

<FONT?>" Some months since a physician from the East visited this city and
gave one or more lectures, by invitation, before the friends of one of
the Medical Colleges in this city. He was on intimate friendly terms
with the faculty of that College, and after his return to Brooklyn he
published a letter in which he charged upon those with whom he had
associated that their conversation led him to suppose that the unlawful
murder of unborn infants was a common occurrence with them and a
lucrative business.   So far as my personal knowledge of the profession\endinput
