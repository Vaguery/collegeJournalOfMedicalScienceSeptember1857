<FONT?>of this city lias extended I consider the charge a base slander, but as I
am not on intimate terms with the members of that Faculty I cannot
answer for them and I leave them to endure the odium the charge has
cast upon them or prove its falsity as they see fit."

<FONT?>Being unwilling to allow such a charge as that contained in the
<i>Observer </i>to rest upon the profession, I expressed my full conviction
that it was a "base slander," leaving those more particularly interested
to answer for themselves, for while I would ever do all I can to sus-
tain the reputation of the profession, I would not presume to be bet-
ter acquainted with the character and practice of Dr. Bauer's friends
than he is.

<FONT?>But hardly had the ink become dry on the pages of the <b>J</b><FONT?><b>ournal</b>, ere
I received the following <i>public document, </i>made intentionally public by
being sent in the form of an <i>open circular </i>through the City Post-Office.

<FONT?><i>" Office of the Cin. Med. Observer.</i>

<FONT?>Dr. <b>C</b><FONT?><b>leaveland.---</b><i>Sir.</i>---As you are fully aware---the allusion to
Dr. Bauer, in your article on <i>"Abortion" </i>in the Aug. No. of the
<b>C</b><FONT?><b>ollege </b><b>J</b><FONT?><b>ournal </b>is grossly and inexcusably false; and the personal
reference to his friends here are as intensely malicious---as unwarrant-
ed ;---the <i>"Observer" </i>therefore declines further exchange.

<FONT?>During the present, "heated term" many have found it difficult to
keep up an equipoise of temperature, but I am of the opinion that the
publisher of the <i>"Observer" </i>must now have as much internal as
external caloric, and according to the Thomsonian notion he is on
the high road to health and happiness. In regard to the " No. 6 " the
"Composition," and the "Capsicum " which he has introduced into
his prescription, since he has manifested a great familiarity with them
I shall leave the readers of the <b>J</b><FONT?><b>ournal </b>to decide if the terms <i>'"false"
</i>and " <i>malicious" </i>do not rather belong to those who publish the " <i>Ob-
server </i>," and write letters, and not to myself.

<FONT?>I have stated no falsehood, but cannot tell whether Dr. Bauer has
or not. I have made no "malicious" accusation against the Editors of
the <i>Observer, </i>or the former Faculty of the Miami Medical College. â™¦
Neither have I allowed the use of the <b>J</b><FONT?><b>ournal </b>of which I am pub-
lisher or any other to do the same. Both the <b>C</b><FONT?><b>ollege </b><b>J</b><FONT?><b>ournal </b>and
its publisher have ever done what they could to sustain the char-
acter and the reputation of the profession, and both can possibly survive
the terrible catastrophy of the threatened loss of " exchange" with the\endinput
