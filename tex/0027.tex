\oldpage{411}of this city lias extended I consider the charge a base slander, but as I
am not on intimate terms with the members of that Faculty I cannot
answer for them and I leave them to endure the odium the charge has
cast upon them or prove its falsity as they see fit.''

Being unwilling to allow such a charge as that contained in the
\emph{Observer} to rest upon the profession, I expressed my full conviction
that it was a ``base slander,'' leaving those more particularly interested
to answer for themselves, for while I would ever do all I can to sustain
the reputation of the profession, I would not presume to be better
acquainted with the character and practice of Dr.\ Bauer's friends
than he is.

But hardly had the ink become dry on the pages of the \textsc{Journal}, ere
I received the following \emph{public document}, made intentionally public by
being sent in the form of an \emph{open circular} through the City Post-Office.

\hfill{}``\emph{Office of the Cin.\ Med.\ Observer.}\quad

\hfill{}\textsc{August 15, 1857.}\quad

\textsc{Dr.\ Cleaveland}.---\emph{Sir}.---As you are fully aware---the allusion to
Dr.\ Bauer, in your article on ``\emph{Abortion}'' in the Aug.\ No\ of the
\textsc{College Journal} is grossly and inexcusably false; and the personal
reference to his friends here are as intensely malicious---as unwarranted;---the
``\emph{Observer}'' therefore declines further exchange.

During the present, ``heated term'' many have found it difficult to
keep up an equipoise of temperature, but I am of the opinion that the
publisher of the ``\emph{Observer}'' must now have as much internal as
external caloric, and according to the Thomsonian notion he is on
the high road to health and happiness. In regard to the ``No.\ 6'' the
``Composition,'' and the ``Capsicum'' which he has introduced into
his prescription, since he has manifested a great familiarity with them
I shall leave the readers of the \textsc{Journal} to decide if the terms ``\emph{false}''
and ``\emph{malicious}'' do not rather belong to those who publish the ``\emph{Observer},''
and write letters, and not to myself.

I have stated no falsehood, but cannot tell whether Dr.\ Bauer has
or not. I have made no ``malicious'' accusation against the Editors of
the \emph{Observer}, or the former Faculty of the Miami Medical College.
Neither have I allowed the use of the \textsc{Journal} of which I am publisher
or any other to do the same. Both the \textsc{College Journal} and
its publisher have ever done what they could to sustain the character
and the reputation of the profession, and both can possibly survive
the terrible catastrophy of the threatened loss of ``exchange'' with the\endinput
